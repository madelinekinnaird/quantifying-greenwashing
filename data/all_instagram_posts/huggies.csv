My heart ached for the people who had lost their jobs, the small business owners, the nurses, doctors and healthcare workers. I put an idea out to my local running group and community to cater a meal for some healthcare workers at a Hospital in NJ- and the running community LITERALLY delivered!! In total we raised $1,200 for and donated 136 meals. And I still ran my marathon! 26.2 miles on local roads near my home raising money for the homeless youth I work with at Covenant House. And my son was waiting for me with the biggest hug at the finish line.\xe2\x80\x9d Jacqueline M.\n.\nThe small things continue to be the big things right now. We continue to be inspired by kindness.

My daughter didn\xe2\x80\x99t have a heartbeat for 13 minutes. It was a blanket of silence while the amazing Neonatal team worked to save her. I heard, \xe2\x80\x98we have a heartbeat\xe2\x80\x99 and saw the top of her little head as they rushed her away. I remember my husband asking \xe2\x80\x98Will she be OK?\xe2\x80\x99 and the nurse replied, \'We\xe2\x80\x99ll let you know as soon as we can.\'\nWe brought her home 29 days later with a dialysis tube, bags of medication and a strict schedule. Cry, pray, laugh, repeat. It felt like forever. I cannot imagine our NICU journey without grandparents and friends who stood in the gap for us. Watching our son, making meals, walking the dog, and most of all, hugging us close when we were broken, scared and tired.\nWorking from home these past weeks, I have that same baby sitting next to me every day. A thriving 9-year old who can push me to my limits. Even on my worst mom days, I couldn\xe2\x80\x99t be more thankful.\nLooking back, I realize how much our NICU stay changed us forever. It challenged, softened and strengthened us. It\xe2\x80\x99s the reason I feel immediate connection with other NICU moms. They truly \xe2\x80\x98get\xe2\x80\x99 it. And it\xe2\x80\x99s why Huggies partnership with Hand to Hold means so much to me personally. These families need a hand to hold more than ever.
