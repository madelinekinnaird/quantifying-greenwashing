This is especially true for Thornhill Canadian Tire Associate Dealer, Craig Knapp, whose daughter is a Neonatal ICU nurse at Mount Sinai Hospital in Toronto, Ontario. Inspired by the work and dedication he sees from his daughter, Knapp stepped in to provide some much-needed relief for the hospital by donating 40,000 surgical masks to staff members. Big thanks to Craig for his donation and to all of the frontline healthcare workers for all of your efforts and dedication. :Canada:\nLink in bio for the latest information on what we\xe2\x80\x99re doing to slow the spread of the virus.'",0,0,1093,43,,,
