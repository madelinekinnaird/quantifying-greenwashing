That's what happened to Tom Klassen late last year during a surprise unveiling at his Cat dealer @finningca. Ivy wrote to Finning, \xe2\x80\x9cMy husband is having a hard time letting Ol' Blue go. He did purchase a new truck, but it doesn\xe2\x80\x99t have a C15. My husband has said there has never been a better engine ever built. The power was unbelievable \xe2\x80\x93 there was not a truck that could out-pull it. Is there any way possible that you would be able to help? If so, that would be fantastic, but if not, I\xe2\x80\x99d just like to say there has never been a better engine ever built.\xe2\x80\x9d From there, Finning partnered with Caterpillar, @MullenTruckingCorp, @InternationalMachinery, and TEPS dealer @JamesWesternStar to surprise this long-time customer. During the big reveal, Tom was led outside of the Finning dealership where the truck was waiting, along with a crowd of onlookers. Tom is looking forward to many more years (and miles) with Ol' Blue as he continues to use the truck for hauling logs. #LetsDoTheWork""",0,0,8416,58,,Finning Canada,52.123631 -122.140277
