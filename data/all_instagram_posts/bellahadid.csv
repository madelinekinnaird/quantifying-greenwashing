I  wake up a majority  of the time sad, fatigued and unmotivated, especially when I\xe2\x80\x99m not working everyday like i usually do. As an empath, I feel my body is telling me I need to not only take care of myself , but continue to engage and support the communities around me . To receive happiness and love in your heart , you must first and foremost give love and happiness to others. Every day (no joke... it brings me joy) I look up, and contact different small groups , or collectives that have singlehandedly been making a conscious effort to help , uplift, share love or provide food/support for whoever around them needs it ... i send them what they need , have a conversation and keep it moving. usually I would just do this without sharing;  it would be too many to post, but sometimes I feel it\xe2\x80\x99s a disservice to these organizations , if I just keep them , and the work that they do, to myself... today I stumbled across @queenscarecollective . They say \xe2\x80\x9csolidarity , not charity\xe2\x80\x9d which to me , is powerful and something we should always direct back to. It\xe2\x80\x99s not doing charity, it\xe2\x80\x99s moving through your everyday life standing in solidarity with your neighbors ,  ones that are less fortunate or people that help our cities run and don\xe2\x80\x99t the have time to care for themselves ... just a reminder to them that they are important and deserve sustenance and support like every living being on this planet. I think it\xe2\x80\x99s so impressive that if we spend just $80 , Queens Care will prepare a whole month worth of farm grown meals for families in need. They deliver meals for 85+ families across the Bronx, but there are still families on their waiting list! This money is not only for food.  if you swipe you can see what these incredible people are doing with our donations. I\xe2\x80\x99m impressed and wanted to share.

Some being incinerated by flames and some choking on smoke to death... their habitats are being demolished and at this rate, koalas will go extinct. @lachlanbailey started a fundraiser with the amazing people at @wireswildliferescue who have been taking in, taking care and giving shelter to any animals in need especially during these horrific months of non stop fire. WIRES is a non- profit , and I\xe2\x80\x99m sure financial aid would be beneficial right now so they can continue to care for these animals. The animals are most likely coming in at an insanely rapid pace right now. I am so sorry Australia :pensive_face: I am sending so much love to you and I am praying this will be over soon... I will be looking for more places to donate , and if you look further down my page, I posted a link where you can donate TREES to the Australian forests.
