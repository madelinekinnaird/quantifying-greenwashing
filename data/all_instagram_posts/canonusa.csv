Our goal is to always create fun-filled sessions that are rich in learning opportunities. This session with Maverick & his gentle Palomino, Pee Wee, was both typical & quite special!\n \nWe teach that our photographer\xe2\x80\x99s visual voice is defined by \'where we stand\' -- both philosophically & physically. In this session we were demonstrating the importance of camera position with exercises in High & Low Angle work. Much of our time is spent on the instruction of \'blind firing\' -- a technique that relies on instinctually aiming the camera without looking through the viewfinder. Once mastered, it allows the photographer who uses a camera that does not have a swiveling LCD to easily get interesting shots from bird\xe2\x80\x99s eye & worm\xe2\x80\x99s eye points-of-view -- perspectives that are otherwise difficult or impossible to achieve. Serendipitously whacky compositions are also commonplace with this technique & oftentimes quite lovely! It does take a while to master but it pays off to be persistent.\n \nIn this more formally-composed long-lens example I had the advantage of the Canon EOS R5\xe2\x80\x99s swiveling LCD touchscreen. I knew that rough-and-tough Maverick was about to unload Pee Wee & I knew my POV needed to be dang close to subterranean in order to tell the story from the cutest perspective. I could have laid on my belly but not wanting to get ants in my pants I twisted the LCD to be parallel with the ground, cradled the zoom in one hand & triggered the shutter by gently tapping on the screen. Timing is everything and I got 2 wonderful moments where everything came together perfectly.\n \nI must say, I love the new RF system! The RF 100-500mm F/4.5-7.1L IS USM zoom is a worthy successor, the proven EF 100-400mm F4.5-5.6L IS USM and the Canon R5\xe2\x80\x99s 45MP sensor, IBIS, and exquisite color science were well worth the wait.

There are all kinds of ways to do it but I have found that it\'s best to go as bright as you can. You want as many lumens as possible. So I finally started working with Canon projectors and they are insane. I\'m currently using the REALiS WX450ST projector in my studio to do all of my projection. I often use two of them, one on the background and one on the subject directly. I love all the crazy results I can get out of it.

""The camera has been my all-access pass to historical moments, championship sporting events and concert stages around the world for nearly 30 years. Most recently, I was on the road with Bon Jovi and Luke Combs while also hosting my exclusive #shootfromthepit live concert photography workshops. As a tour photographer, my goal is to capture the show in a new way each night while also documenting life on the road for the artists and their fans.\n\nRunning thousands of frames though my cameras every day means that the gear I use has to withstand the enormous pressures I put on it. The Canon EOS-1D X Mark II - and now the Mark III - bodies are built to last, shoot 14-20 frames a second, and handle high ISOs like 6400 and 12,800 without a problem. I carry two on my shoulders during the show with the EF 24-105 and 100-400 lenses so I can quickly switch from wide to tight without missing any of the action on stage.\n\nI use remote cameras to make unique images from locations that may not be accessible during the show. I put another EOS-1D X Mark II on stage with a 24-70 2.8, and the smaller/lighter EOS 5D Mark IV overhead in the lighting truss with the 11-24. My fifth traveling body is the full-frame EOS R mirrorless with the RF 28-70 f/2, which is like having three prime lenses in one. Because I can shoot silently and in very low light, I carry this setup with me backstage during the day to capture candid moments using only available light. I have the EF-EOS-R adapter just in case I want to use the R with one of my EF lenses.\n\nI always have at least one 600EX II-RT Speedlite to shoot the artist\xe2\x80\x99s \'meet and greet\' photos, and can make a simple one light portrait using the ST-E3-RT wireless transmitter if the opportunity arises. The other items needed to complete my kit include remote mounting hardware and transceivers, a card wallet, backup hard drives, in-ear monitors, and gaffers tape.""'",0,0,16304,112,,,

But the key part for me in making this photo work, wasn\'t just the lighting, it was the lens choice. Normally I\'m a sucker for a 50mm 1.2 lens, but I\'ve been happily using the RF 28-70mm f/2 L USM lately because of the nice low aperture that I love and the ability to zoom in and out at will rather than changing a lens. That really came in handy here since the model had a beautifully flowy dress on and I wanted to enhance its movement and size. I was able to zoom all the way out at 28mm and duck a little bit lower, just enough to let the lens distortion work for me and accentuate the dress. Shooting at 1/200th of a second was the perfect speed to let a little motion blur happen in the dress, but still keep my model\'s face tack sharp - plus with the Canon EOS R5\'s incredible auto focus technology I had no problem locking onto her eye for perfect focus even with the dress moving around in front of her face.\n\nSwipe left for a look at the EOS R5\'s 4k 120p video (because who wouldn\'t want to play with that if you can?!) a behind the scenes video of this shoot for @Adorama with @alliecizek.""\n\nCamera: #Canon EOS R5\nLens: RF 28-70mm f/2 L USM\nAperture: f/5\nISO: 200\nShutter Speed: 1/200 sec\nFocal Length: 28mm'",0,0,9219,56,,,

One of my favorite techniques for such subjects is focus bracketing (also called focus stacking), where a series of images are captured at slightly overlapping planes of focus, then composited in post-capture software into one sharply detailed image file. While I have accomplished this process manually for many years, Canon\xe2\x80\x99s EOS RP, 90D, and the new EOS R5 have automated the focus-bracketing capture process in camera. For this image, I brought the plant into the studio with the tripod-mounted EOS R5 and the Canon EF 100mm f/2.8L Macro IS USM lens and set the camera to capture 71 focus-bracketed images at f/8, ISO 400. I lit the setup with three small, inexpensive LED lights: two positioned to the right and left of the subject, with the left about 1.5 stops less intense, and one diffused light attached to the lens, just bright enough to fill in the dark areas at the base of the plant.

I had been on Shaman, a 88ft sailboat in Svalbard archipelago part of the Norwegian Arctic for about two weeks and had had this shot in mind for days, I was waiting for the right time! Finally we had lots of ice, no wind or swell and beautiful arctic light and I thought now or never. I told the owner my idea and he jumped at it, let\'s do it! We picked a good looking iceberg, right size and one that dropped straight off so that we could come nice and close without hitting it! I grabbed the bosun\'s chair (similar to a climbing harness) and attached it to the mainsail halyard (sailors name for a rope that hoists the sails to the top of the mast). Up I went with my two way radio in hand and my camera gear in a plastic bucket tied to the bosun\'s chair below me. Around my neck was my camera. In the bucket was a Canon 16-35 mm lens and a 14mm lens. Which lens worked best would be decided from my lofty perch 110 ft up at the top of the mast. I wanted to shoot wide enough to get my orange boots in the bottom of the frame and the horizon and iceberg in the top of the frame. I hung out up there and talked the captain of the boat in to position, a little to port, now a little to starbard, slowly ahead, ok stop. Hold it right here. I decided that the rectilinear Canon EF 14mm lens was the way to go. It got it all in with zero distortion. The view from up high was amazing, a true bird\'s eye view, a stunning sight and perspective. The captain kept the boat perfectly on station and I clicked away and got the shot.

The bag itself is literally falling apart because it is so well-worn, but I can\xe2\x80\x99t bear to part with it because it is my \'good luck\' bag. For the goodies inside, I have been a Canon shooter for years and I always carry two bodies. I love the quick focus on the new Canon bodies. I don\xe2\x80\x99t go anywhere without my short and longer zooms 16-35mm 2.8 LII USM and 24-70mm 2.8 LII \xe2\x80\x94 those are my workhorses and the rest are \'on occasion\' but I have to carry just in case. I do use the 100mm 2.8 macro at times for details, and the 70-200mm 2.8 is great in case if I am further away from the action than I like to be. But the 16-35 and 24-70 are in my sweet spot and I love to be close to my subject which those lenses invite. I also am very attached to the Canon flashes which are almost always on my camera for a little fill. I also love to take the flash off camera and use the remote Speedlite Transmitter ST-E3-RT, especially if I have an assistant who can hold it off camera. And my limit to what I bring on the road is what I can tetris into my Think Tank Airport Security rolly including my field notebook, pen, gaff tape, \xe2\x80\x9cparty\xe2\x80\x9d gels for the flash, sunscreen, zoom recorder and mic. My feeling is that anything that gets packed in a case in cargo may not make it in time for my shoot, so I keep my Think Tank carry-on full of the absolute necessities and pack my camera bag inside the rolly so I am ready to go on arrival. Of course, the  video cameras, C300 EF, also pictured don\xe2\x80\x99t fit into my carry on and are part of a bigger film package we add on if we are also shooting for a film. But I love shooting stills as part of my films so I try to have my basic camera bag on me at all times, even when I am directing film.

Since I knew I would be using backlight for her hair, I wanted to equally illuminate her face. I brought in a Westcott FJ 400 strobe with a beauty dish modifier. I positioned the light a bit higher than her eye level and close to the center of her face. I did not want to over power the backlight and wanted some of the hair to be over exposed to create the look she wanted.

It was the last journey of the Endeavor, and its final destination would be the California Science Center. I\xe2\x80\x99ve photographed two shuttle launches, the first in 1998.

They had been pretty specific about the flight path, so I found a good spot that I thought would work, but it came in higher and from a different angle. The good news was that there was a young woman nearby working out on the rings that made excellent foreground. She was a terrific gymnast, so I started shooting the shuttle as she flew through the air with the greatest of ease. The magic moment came as she looked up at the shuttle, and it was perfect. California Girl and Space Shuttle. What more could you want? And there was even a bonus element, a yellow parasail at the bottom left of the frame.

The trick was to be in the middle of the path of totality, and out of the way of the clouds. I chose Monmouth, Oregon in the Willamette Valley to take the shot, and it paid off.\n\nDuring a total solar eclipse, the moon passes between earth and the sun, blocking out the sun\xe2\x80\x99s light. At that moment the white corona, which is the outer layer of the sun\xe2\x80\x99s atmosphere, can clearly be seen surrounding the eclipsed sun.  It was a spectacular sight. A bonus was to also document a solar prominence on the top and right side of the sun. A prominence is a bright, fiery, gaseous event that emanates from the sun\xe2\x80\x99s surface, often in the shape of a loop. A typical prominence can extend more than 62,000 miles from the sun\xe2\x80\x99s surface, and is ten times the size of earth. Some reach more than 300,000 miles into space.\n\nTo accomplish this photograph I used a Canon 5DS R with a Canon 800mm f/5.6 lens coupled with a 1.4 Extender II, making it 1120mm. The ISO was 320, the exposure 1/320 at f/8. It would not have been possible to see the prominence without this long lens.\n\nIf I\xe2\x80\x99m lucky enough to witness another solar eclipse, I will choose the Canon 1200mm with the 1.4 extender. That will give me a 1680mm look at another amazing celestial event! My intention is to photograph the April 8, 2024 eclipse from Burlington, Vermont.""

The instant I saw it I knew I had to use it as a \xe2\x80\x9cHanging Miniature\xe2\x80\x9d; a forced-perspective, in-camera, special effect technique widely used in pre-digital Hollywood. \nIdeation: With this technique in mind, I got the idea of creating my own comic book! \nPreparation: I wanted a strong female protagonist so I recruited Natasha, an imaginative cosplay model who can act. After considering my storyline I sketched a few concept frames, went shopping for some military props, discovered Ducky the Doll, and built my character a bazooka out of PVC pipe and scrap aluminum. Low cost and loads of fun!\n\nExecution: I twisted an EF 24-70mm F4L IS zoom onto my 50.6MP Canon EOS 5Ds R, tucked the tank in my pocket, and off to the desert we went. Knowing that I had to leave room for my actress to act, I composed my frames with just the right amount of negative space. I set my camera to Manual Mode, Daylight WB, ISO 400, F/16, 1/85th. Two weeks later, after a quick stop at a Halloween shop to buy wound-and-bruise make-up, I met my actress at a tiny rental studio in downtown LA. As the model did her make-up, I set up three full-spectrum LED lights. My key-light was set to 5600K WB and my two kickers were orange.

This was one of those skin-pinching moments and I wanted to give them everything they expected (a bright, natural light look), but find a way to do a little something extra too. :sparkles: After seeing this dress, I knew we needed to play a bit! It was right after sunset so we were losing light fast, and I wanted to give the dress a bit of flirty movement, ensure that all of the details were crisp and the model was in focus, but separate her from the background using lens compression, a shallower f-stop and a rim light. \nI had my assistant walking with the model (Nikki), pointing a Profoto B2 with an OCF beauty dish at the model as she walked towards me and turned left to right. In the back, I placed a Profoto B1 on a light stand with a CTO gel to match the warm light given off by the lanterns on the chapel wall. I used TTL to get my initial flash power settings, and then switched to manual to adjust.\n\nThis is my favorite shot because of how the dressed flared and her expression. Some of the other photos had slightly better light on the model\'s face because she was towards the light a bit more, but this is still my favorite because, for me, expression is top priority. I stick by this priority in most of my shooting because my non-photographer clients don\'t see light and posing the way that I do, and don\'t know the difference between good and great. But they do know the difference between good and great expressions and eye-catching dress twirls.

You can try to sneak up on them to get that close-up, but be prepared for rejection as they just move farther away. As I have repeatedly advised, getting close to birds in the wild typically requires that the photographer employ a photo blind to obscure the human form and movement while being careful to protect the subjects themselves. \nRecently, I used my house as a blind. I noticed that birds were coming to a feeder located close to a window, and that the light being reflected on the outside of the window obscured the birds\xe2\x80\x99 view of movement inside. I knew that I had an unusual chance to capture intimate portraits, so I put together the perfect rig for the job. First, the new Canon EOS 90D with 32.5 MP of resolution and its APS-C sensor with its 1.6x crop factor that helps to fill the frame. Next, the Canon EF 100-400mm f4.5-5.6L Mark II lens that gives great close-ups and focuses to 3.2 feet. Then I had one more trick up my sleeve, and that was a 1.4x extender on the 400mm, all giving me an equivalent focal length of 896mm, perfect for larger birds such as jays, from a distance of about three feet. Or, for smaller species such as hummingbirds, a 2x extender achieving 1280mm at the same range. With the gear at hand, all I had to do was configure a lighting setup that would shoot through two panes of glass, balance the shady foreground with the sunny background, and get me to an aperture of f/22 for maximum depth of field. I found that solution in the Canon Speedlite 600EX-RT flash concentrated by 3 f/stops with a MagMod MagBeam attachment. \nThen all I had to do was wait for the birds to arrive. They did!

While patiently waiting for the milky way to rise into the desired position I took multiple test shots, making adjustments and working my way towards the final settings. Blowing out the night sky milky way and the bright fresnel was a major concern, so I used a piece of paper that I positioned in front of my lens periodically during the long exposure time.
