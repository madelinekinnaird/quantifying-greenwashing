LM Wind Power, a GE Renewable Energy subsidiary, has hundreds of thousands of blades at wind farms globally. They monitor and maintain working blades through regular blade inspections by skilled technicians. Technicians climb the turbines, equipped with thermographic cameras that can sense heat from friction caused by micro imperfections in the blade\xe2\x80\x99s composite layers.
