The figures show that the violence has intensified: there was almost twice as much police intervention at home over this period ... They were also less able to escape or to ask for help since their partner was constantly on their backs. The associations we support have therefore found it difficult to cope and our mission has been to help them, everywhere in France, not to leave any woman without solution. Deconfinement does not, however, represent the end of the crisis because associations see a massive increase in demands from women who are now ""liberated"". It is an influx that will require resources that they do not always have. \nFaced with the situation, from the first days of confinement, we switched the entire \xc2\xab Fondation des Femmes \xc2\xbbto emergency mode. Our goal has been to support a maximum of associations in contact with women in danger so that they can adapt their activity to the situation and meet the growing needs. The \xc2\xab Fondation des Femmes \xc2\xbb thus carried out an audit of needs throughout France, then launched an emergency collection to deal with this unprecedented crisis and was able to collect more than 2.5 million euros. These funds were redistributed to support associations in their transition to telework and allow them to continue to help, but also to unlock 40,000 nights of emergency accommodation, and buy basic necessities for the women who escaped. without having had time to prepare for their departure ... It also supported initiatives so that women could discreetly call for help, such as the 7/7 shift to the support chat for victims of violence commentonsaime.fr and the improvement of the App-Elles application which allows discreet alerting. In total, 125 associations and thousands of women all over France were able to be supported via our #ToutesSolidaires emergency system thanks to a massive mobilization of donors and patrons. \xc2\xbb\n\n#association#caregiver#bnpp#covid19#potd#portrait'",0,0,108,5,,"Paris, France",48.8573 2.3492

Yet, what is happening has put a strain on us too, aware that we are in a very complex, unpredictable scenario: the virus is an invisible enemy, capable of overpowering even the strongest will. We too had losses among our rescuers. But ItRC Volunteers passed this test, demonstrating unparalleled resilience.

You ask yourself questions like: What does my job mean? What is its purpose? What service do I deliver? You focus on what's important rather than administrative problems. In my view, you get a clearer, concrete perception of your role and the value that you contribute. I work for the BNP Paribas Group's IT. By producing applications for the Group's Functions and the Group itself, we ultimately serve all bank users. In these strange times, people have had high expectations of the IT team. We found ourselves dealing with \xe2\x80\x9cdouble trouble\xe2\x80\x9d now that everyone is working remotely.  We had to keep IT services running smoothly so that people can do their job and stay in contact, while overcoming the difficulties faced by our team and its members individually. It was necessary to adapt the availability of IT systems and applications so that each user could connect and work from home. In the early days of confinement, that represented quite a hurdle because of the sheer size of our workload. The profiles of application use were changing in a big way and, at the same time, the volume and frequency of from-home connections via VPNs surged. The objective was to keep systems going so that, for each employee, it would be \xe2\x80\x9cbusiness as usual\xe2\x80\x9d insofar as possible. Everyone had to be more committed at the level of our teams. And each member of the IT team committed to making that happen. They say every cloud has a silver lining. In this crisis, I would say the silver lining is the way individuals have stepped up to serve the community, our business and our customers. I thank all of my colleagues. I know it's been hard for everyone. Many users tend to have a negative view of IT and, on that score, I have to thank you for showing understanding. On our side, we'll be doing everything possible to make the applications available and keep them running. Last but not least, everyone, take good care and stay safe!\n.\n:paintbrush: @tyter_tanovitch .\n#friday#vendredi#drawing#bnpparibas#bnpp#story#employee#covid19#potd""",0,0,108,3,,France,47.0 2.0

Today, clients want reassurance about the continuity and durability of the banking service as a whole in this very difficult climate where some companies are forced to close down. They also expect from us economic solutions, given the short-time working required for some of them and company closures facing others. On one hand, it is showing that we are still here for them, to grant credit if necessary, either cash loans or other forms. On the other hand, to suspend deadlines for loans, which we are doing every day. The most difficult thing for us is overcoming the shortage of staff, because unfortunately, some of our colleagues have had to stay at home. Even though, the number of requests from customers is dropping, it is difficult to set up an organization and adapt it in order to always respond instantly to clients. A second difficulty we are having is all these changes. Organizational changes, as I\xe2\x80\x99ve said, changes in the different processes to be used, changes also occasioned by Government measures, which change from day to day, or at least weekly, and we can clearly see that the company is trying to position itself in relation to that. It is not always easy. What are the positives we will take away from this crisis? We see is a build-up of solidarity between teams, which was already present, and which is of necessity more visible in times of crisis, when there is a pooling of strengths and a certain unity develops, we have advisers from some branches who are helping other branches out and vice versa. Whether they are advisers, branch managers or management team members.
