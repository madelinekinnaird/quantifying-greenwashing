Demand has been so high for dog and cat companionship, many shelters had waiting lists at one point. But 2019 was a different story...\n\nDash, a white and tan pit bull, was one of the longest residents at macc. Older pit bulls are often shelter veterans, as many adopters look for small dogs and puppies.\n\nMolly Romine, a State Farm employee and shelter volunteer, knew Dash would make a great addition to someone\xe2\x80\x99s family. That's why she and other volunteers helped organize a 12 Dogs of Christmas adoption push last December. \n\nThe shelter\xe2\x80\x99s 12 longest-term residents were all pit bulls ranging in age from 2 to 10. The team spruced up their kennels with eye-catching decor, gave the doggies holiday makeovers and shared social media posts to gain attention. The shelter also offered stockings full of donated leashes, collars and free training sessions.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cI worked a couple of hours a night to get these dogs a home for the holidays,\xe2\x80\x9d shared Molly. \xe2\x80\x9cIt was a lot of hard work but it was worth it to see Dash and all the other dogs adopted just before New Year\xe2\x80\x99s Eve!\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nVolunteering has been difficult during COVID-19 due to social distancing and other safety measures, but there are still ways to give back.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cIf you\xe2\x80\x99re not sure adoption is for you, consider fostering! It\xe2\x80\x99s a short-term commitment with long-term impacts,\xe2\x80\x9d Molly recommends. \xe2\x80\x9cIf you foster a pet, you are giving that animal a much needed respite from the stressful shelter environment. You can also provide the shelter with helpful intel. Maybe the dog is great with kids but scared of car rides. This can really help match the pup with the right family.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nThis #GivingTuesday, reach out to your local animal shelter to find out how you can add a new family member to your home through fostering or adoption. #GoodNeighbor #PetAdoption""",0,0,615,32,,,

Leave 2 feet between the tank and the burner when using a propane-powered fryer.\n\nFollow the manufacturer's instructions to avoid overfilling. Oil can ignite when it makes contact with the burner.\n\nChoose a smaller turkey for frying. A bird that's 8 to 10 pounds is best. Pass on turkeys over 12 pounds.\n\nMake sure the turkey is thawed and dry before cooking. Ice or water can cause flare-ups if mixed with hot oil.\n\nTurn off the burner before lowering the turkey into the oil. Once the turkey is submerged, turn the burner on.\n\nWear goggles to shield your eyes, use oven mitts to protect your hands and arms, and keep a grease-rated fire extinguisher close by.\n\nWatch the oil temperature carefully. Cooking oil that is heated beyond its smoke point can catch fire. If you notice the oil is smoking, turn the fryer off.\n\nKeep children and pets away from the fryer at all times.\n\nOnce finished, carefully remove the pot from the burner, place it on a level surface and cover  to let the oil cool overnight before disposing.\n\nWatch the weather.
