And with that, the duo of Elias and Suzuki were off and running.\n\nThe Spaniard came to the United States with the reputation as a world-beater, having previously earned the 2010 Moto2 World Championship along with Grand Prix race wins in the MotoGP, Moto2, 250cc, and 125cc World Championships. As lofty as the expectations may have been based on his international credentials, he more than lived up to them, forcing the remainder of the paddock to up their game significantly or get left in his wake.\n\nHis ultra-aggressive riding style, ability to eat up big gaps on the brakes, square up corners, and pull off nearly unfathomable overtaking maneuvers forever changed premier-class racing in the United States and allowed him to rack up 32 career MotoAmerica Superbike race wins and 60 podiums in the process.\n\nThe high point of his MotoAmerica Superbike career with Suzuki came in 2017. That season he powered to the championship on the strength of 10 victories and 18 combined podiums, never finishing lower than second in any race in which he took the checkered flag.\n\nToni also endeared himself to Suzuki\xe2\x80\x99s racing family with his love for racing and infectious attitude.\n\nElias recently announced on social media that it was time to move on and that his future plans remain uncertain, including the possibility that this weekend\xe2\x80\x99s MotoAmerica finale at Laguna Seca could mark the end of his legendary career.\n\nToni Elias, Team Hammer, and Suzuki Motor of America, Inc. will look to continue their strong form and close out the 2020 season with a flourish at the 2020 MotoAmerica season finale, which will take place at WeatherTech Raceway Laguna Seca in Monterey, California this weekend. #Suzuki #SuzukiCycles #GSXR #ThankYou #suzukifamily'",0,0,4918,19,,,

The latest entry into the V-STROM legend is here to help you escape into the wilderness and explore to your heart\xe2\x80\x99s content. A sleek look with the latest features allows for a smooth and comfortable ride. Limitless potential is engineered in so you can continue your adventure without pause.\n-\nDistinctive styling incorporates elements of both Suzuki\xe2\x80\x99s legendary DR-Z Dakar racer and the large DualSport DR-Big. The characteristic beak design first adopted by Suzuki stays true to its heritage while being more aggressive and bolder for the new generation V-STROM.\n-\nThe V-STROM s 1037cc, 90-degree V-twin engine has more peak power than ever before while maintaining its strong pull off the bottom and superb fuel economy while complying with emissions standards worldwide. New camshafts and pistons are fed by a pair of large, 49mm, Ride-by-Wire electronic throttle bodies that deliver smooth, light throttle grip action while allowing the addition of a precise cruise control system.\n-\nThe V-STROM\xe2\x80\x99s durable, twin-spar aluminum frame balances weight and rigidity for optimal handling on all types of roads. The cast aluminum swingarm is controlled by a single rear shock with remote, hydraulic spring preload adjustment so adjusting for cargo or a passenger takes just seconds. Up front, the inverted KYB fork has spring preload adjustment plus both compression and rebound damping force adjustment for easy tuning. In popular 19- and 17-inch sizes, Bridgestone Battlax Adventure A41 tires are fitted to the tubeless, spoke-style wheels.\n-\nLike every V-Strom before it, the style, performance, and value of the 2020 V-STROM 1050XT will be instantly recognized by experienced and enthusiastic riders. No other adventure bike can deliver the combination of features with the promise of trouble-free travel like the V-STROM 1050XT.\n- - -\n#Suzuki #SuzukiCycles #VSTROM'",0,0,6507,37,,,

The KATANA\xe2\x80\x99s dramatic bodywork rests upon a twin-spar, aluminum alloy frame, and Superbike-type braced swingarm that provides great road holding performance.\n---\nThe stunning styling and performance features of the new KATANA will attract a variety of riders, especially those who value owning a unique motorcycle. Experienced riders fondly remember the original Katana and will want to own the new KATANA so their ride is linked to history. Some potential KATANA riders are seeking out a motorcycle with a distinctive appearance with quality fit and finish that will also deliver an exciting riding experience.
