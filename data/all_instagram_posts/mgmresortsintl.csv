I stepped forward. \nThe first bedroom we did was for a little girl, she was about 4 years old. We decided to create a mermaid-inspired bedroom since she loved The Little Mermaid. After we finished the room that day, her parents brought her to see it. The Father and Mother were crying, overwhelmed with joy\xe2\x80\xa6this was the first time I worked to help a child with cancer and to witness a family struggling to keep their child alive and safe, and doing the best they can. And at that moment the mother wanted to say a prayer; as a Hawaiian we say \xe2\x80\x98Pule\xe2\x80\x99 (to pray for blessing). As I left their home that day, all of the volunteers (who I thought were hardened or tough) were teary-eyed and asked, \xe2\x80\x98when is the next one, when is the next one?\xe2\x80\x99 So, we continued on making Special Spaces for kids. And today, that 4-year old girl is still alive and doing well; I still keep in-touch with the family...the prayers and 'Ohana' of that moment will always be with me.\n\nFor Hawaiians, \xe2\x80\x98Ohana\xe2\x80\x99 means family and it\xe2\x80\x99s so important to me\xe2\x80\xa6and not only to me but everybody really\xe2\x80\xa6it\xe2\x80\x99s the reason why we are here every day to work\xe2\x80\x94for your kids, your family.\xe2\x80\x9d A selfless volunteer, Hiro Kajiyama, is focused on #WhatMatters.\xc2\xa0We are proud to share MGM union carpenter and Chapter Director of Special Spaces, Hiroshi Kajiyama\xe2\x80\x99s story of helping those in need through his ongoing volunteerism.""",0,0,327,8,,b'Mandalay Bay Resort and Casino',36.092211836 -115.1747899689
