My anxiety and depression were at an all time high, and creating was the only thing that deafened the anxious thoughts and feelings. Playing with clay was the only thing that helped my mental health, and it still is.\xc2\xa0Which is why I use the hashtag #ClayToCope. I started with pottery and quickly found my way to the polymer side of clay, where I could both get my hands dirty, be creative, AND finish with a piece of art that you can wear.\n\nPut me in a room with a desk, some clay and I\xe2\x80\x99m the happiest girl in the world. But turning that passion into a business didn\xe2\x80\x99t come without challenges. It took a lot of time, research, and support from my friends and family to figure out how things should run smoothly, and efficiently. That\xe2\x80\x99s one reason why I\xe2\x80\x99m so blessed to be a part of such a loving community of clay artists.\xc2\xa0\n\nGetting to create polymer clay art every single day is an absolute dream come true, it truly means the world to me. I thank my supporters every day, because they allow me to keep creating. There is nothing like having someone adorn themselves with something that you\xe2\x80\x99ve made with your own two hands. The feeling is unreal.\n\nMy aim is to help any artist by uplifting and supporting them, so they can have a successful business. And for me consistency is key. I say this to myself almost every day, or to fellow artists as encouragement. There are times when you feel discouraged, run down, burned out and wanting to quit, but you CANNOT stop. You have to keep pushing. Because every day you work, is one day closer to the goals you\xe2\x80\x99ve set.\xe2\x80\xaa\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\xac\n\n- Krymsyn, owner @indigo.sands \n\n#supportsmallbusinesses #supportsmallbusiness #smallbusinessowner'",0,0,522,43,,,

I started the business because I wanted to see globally sourced products have the same farm to table ethos and the same quality standards as local produce. I felt that I gained so much from knowing who grew my peaches and who grew my tomatoes and I felt like there was so much power in creating that connection in terms of who grew your spices on the other side of the world. The best part is that we are able to work with ten of the best farms from six different states across India right now and pay them 6X the price they were making before, which means they went from earning $4500 a year to now getting paid $26,000 a year. It\xe2\x80\x99s pretty amazing.\n\nBut I\xe2\x80\x99ve set it up so eventually, we can transfer ownership to our farm partners. I work in service of our farmers, my job is to market what they grow. Otherwise, the power always lies with the trader. I\xe2\x80\x99m the middleman right now between our farmers and our customers so the power lives with us. If we\xe2\x80\x99re actually all about building out a spice trade, the real solution is to give our farmers the power to be their own middlemen and truly be direct to consumer and we\xe2\x80\x99re trying to figure out how to do that. \xc2\xa0\n\nIt\xe2\x80\x99s also really meaningful to me because it allows me to retain a connection to my home, India.

We were both educators training youth in Memphis neighborhoods on how to use literature and the arts to build paths out of poverty. After helping to start a performing arts school in South Memphis that was closed due to lack of funding, we decided we were tired of waiting. The best way to do fund our non profit work in our neighborhood was to create a for-profit business around an industry that encapsulated all of our areas of passion. History, literature, the arts, and of course, coffee.\xc2\xa0\n\nWe work really hard to think and speak about coffee from Black and African perspectives, which can often lead to a sort of imposter syndrome when we look at other coffee companies in the industry. The Black story is kind of unheard of in our market. That\xe2\x80\x99s also become our biggest strength though. We\xe2\x80\x99re telling a story that has been ignored for a long time, and as such we\xe2\x80\x99re reaching customers who\xe2\x80\x99ve been ignored in the market as well.\xc2\xa0\n\nOur brand and business represents liberation for our family and our community. It represents pride in our heritage and hope in our future. It represents ways out of poverty, opportunities for legal entrepreneurship, for those incarcerated by the illegal drug trade started by the war on drugs, and a chance to reconnect with a community we\xe2\x80\x99ve lost significant connections to because of slavery. Our coffee, Guji Mane, represents one of the most quintessential parts about Black diaspora culture, and that\xe2\x80\x99s our ability to take things that have colonial connotations and identify them as authentically black. The clearest representation of this is seen in hip hop. Through it we reclaim our past and reimagine our future. That\xe2\x80\x99s the power of sampling. And that\xe2\x80\x99s what we\xe2\x80\x99re doing with Cxffee.

I always knew I was going to be an entrepreneur, I just didn\xe2\x80\x99t know how it was going to manifest. I think a lot of female-led companies start out finding a void that\xe2\x80\x99s not fulfilled and we create a product for ourselves, eventually finding others with the same challenge and turn that in to a business. So for me, I was just making hair products for myself and people started noticing my hair and complimenting it. \n\nFast forward 18 months and I had a hair product line for myself, but I ended up getting laid off. I was the Global Digital Communications Director at Ford, so I had a big job with a whole lot of money. But I was also in the midst of leaving a very abusive marriage. It was abusive in every sense you can imagine - financial, physical, emotional. I left that marriage because I had a one year old son at the time and I knew that I was, essentially, raising someone else\xe2\x80\x99s husband. I refused to have him grow up seeing what was going on and have him thinking that\'s what love looked like or that it should be the norm. \n\nWhen I got divorced and laid off at the same time, I went from being the breadwinner of the family to being a single mom with $32 in my bank account. I thought, ""Okay, I can either go find a trap house, hop on somebody\xe2\x80\x99s pole or try to sell this hair product I\xe2\x80\x99ve been working on."" I went with option C. That was seven years ago and now we are in 1200 stores, sold on every continent and we\'ve saved over 70,000 women more than 1.2 million minutes on their hair care. Not to mention I became the 1st Black woman in history to own a patent on a plant-based hair care product.\n\nSo that\xe2\x80\x99s how I got into entrepreneurship. It helped free me, because if I did not have this hobby and had not discovered this need, I would probably still be in a situation that was very harmful and it would have been my downfall.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nGwen Jimmere, Founder @naturalicious_beauty \n\n#photooftheday #withhumans #discoverportrait #entrepreneurship #entrepreneurmindset #entrepreneurlife'",0,0,1174,67,,,

Little by little, every time I sat with her, she would teach me something new and eventually she taught me everything I knew. This lead me to pursue a career in fashion design and in my last year of college, I finally decided to go up to my professor and ask them if I could create a plus size collection. They told me it would be hard but they believed in me. With that collection I was able to present, for the first time, in New York City for Full Figure Fashion Week. \n\nIt was a huge moment for me and it was the first time I was meeting the plus sized community. My collection was inspired by clothing that I wanted to wear, that I wanted to see other plus sized women wear. Soon after the fashion show, I received an email to apply for Project Runway. But it came two days after my grandmother had passed away. I didn\xe2\x80\x99t really know how to take the email. It was an amazing opportunity but I was at a crossroads. \n\nAfter losing my grandmother, I didn\xe2\x80\x99t know if I wanted to continue designing because at that moment I felt like I lost everything - she was the one person who mattered the most to me and she was no longer here.

Instead of responding with my fists, I'm eternally grateful that my parents taught me how to respond with kindness. This helped shape my path. Drawing upon my own experiences, I had an innate desire to understand how others responded to bigotry and inequities. Although I had my own missteps, I became an ally before I knew the word, a voice of reason looking to add more voices to the conversation whether it be speaking up against homophobic slurs on the ball field or denouncing sexist rhetoric in the classroom.\n\nThat sense of curiosity and social justice led me to careers in law and civil rights.

From 1999 to 2012, I worked in the entertainment industry; primarily in hip-hop. A woman working in hip-hop in the late 90\xe2\x80\x99s was a rare sight. By proxy, I became a trusted confidant for men that personified \xe2\x80\x98hardcore\xe2\x80\x99 and had nowhere to be vulnerable. I started a blog about the lessons learned from the music business, sharing the tips and tools I'd used to cope when times were tough. I trained to be a mentor, became a certified life coach, and started public speaking to start a dialogue on the trappings of fame. After having twin girls in 2013, I knew I couldn\xe2\x80\x99t return to the music biz. I began lecturing at post-secondary schools about Mental Health and Wellness. Success in this role looked like trust and engagement. Intangible yet priceless. Seeing an audience having lightbulb moments, or hearing the words, \xe2\x80\x9cI never thought of it like that before\xe2\x80\x9d were my metrics of success. But it takes a lot of energy to hold that space and be present, and then juggle life with twins and being newly divorced.\n\nI never saw myself working in Tech because I was intimidated by what \xe2\x80\x9cworking in tech\xe2\x80\x9d\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0might mean.

After 10 years of solopreneurship, I discovered Shopify and suddenly \xe2\x80\x9cworking in tech\xe2\x80\x9d looked different than what I imagined.  At Shopify, I do what I've always done. I aim to make intimidating topics approachable, to make vulnerability a source of strength, and to normalize the integration of wellbeing into our work.

I terrorized my parents as a child with non-stop begging for a dog. I went to business school and became an accountant, but always knew I wanted to centre my career around animals. Shortly after I qualified for my accounting degree, we adopted our first (of 3) pug, Bella. Bella had come from a puppy mill environment, and sadly she had never been outside of a cage for her five months of life, and was very unaccustomed to the outdoors. As we worked to help Bella acclimatize to the outdoors, we went to some local pet shops to find her a coat.\xc2\xa0 I found that the outerwear options lacked functionality and style, and I couldn't find any products I was excited about.  At the time, fashion-forward outerwear brands had become a massive trend for \xe2\x80\x9chumans,\xe2\x80\x9d but there were no options that offered similar style, function and quality for pets.\n\nLike many entrepreneurs, my lightbulb moment happened when I identified a gap in the market from my own experience with Bella. I could see that there was room to create elevated products, and to build a brand that pet parents could turn to again and again to meet their pet outerwear needs. The brand has since evolved to lead the pet lifestyle category, with a wide range of products that include everything from rainwear to harnesses, and pet parent items such as dog walking fanny packs and gloves.""",0,0,1561,36,,,
