They block and scatter UV radiation before it can penetrate the skin. They sit on top of the skin and start protecting immediately. Although they can be a little more difficult to apply and may leave a white residue, they\xe2\x80\x99re less irritating and a good option for those with sensitive skin. The FDA has declared that these sunscreen ingredients are \xe2\x80\x9cgenerally regarded as safe and effective.\xe2\x80\x9d\n \nChemical sunscreens work by absorbing UV rays, changing them to heat, then releasing the heat from the skin:hot_springs_selector:. The most common ingredients include oxybenzone, avobenzone, homosalate, octisalate, octinoxate, and octocrylene. Because absorption into the skin is required for effective protection, these sunscreens should be applied 30 minutes before going outdoors. When compared to physical sunscreens, these are lightweight, invisible and easier to apply, but may cause allergic reactions and irritate sensitive skin.\n \nYou can find sunscreen formulations as creams, gels, lotions, oils, sprays, sticks, or pastes. Gels might be easier for hairy areas, sprays for wet skin:sweat_droplets:, creams for dry skin and faces, and sticks for around the eyes:eyes:. Do not use sprays near your face and be careful not to inhale.\n \nAlways use a broad spectrum sunscreen with an SPF of 30+ every day, even when it\xe2\x80\x99s cloudy. (The higher the SPF #, the longer time it protects.) The average adult should use about 1 ounce:lotion_bottle:(2 tablespoons) for full application. REAPPLY every 2 hours and immediately after swimming :woman_swimming_selector: or excessive sweating.\n.\nYou can also protect yourself by limiting :sun_selector: exposure during peak hours from 10am to 4pm, seeking shade when possible :beach_with_umbrella: and wearing protective clothing, a hat :billed_cap: and UV-blocking sunglasses :sunglasses:.\n.\nSources: American Academy of Pediatrics, American Academy of Dermatology, Skin Cancer Foundation, Mayo Clinic'",0,0,56,7,,,

Heat cramps are the cramping of major muscles:flexed_biceps_light_skin_tone:(quads, hamstrings, core, arms), that are stressed in a hot environment. If other symptoms are included, such as light-headedness, weakness, nausea, vomiting, or headache, we move to heat exhaustion. The most critical and severe condition is heat stroke. Heat stroke is identified by a very high fever:thermometer: (103\xc2\xbaF and up), :pouting_face:hot, red skin without signs of sweating, a rapid pulse and :exploding_head:throbbing headache. :ambulance: Seek emergency medical help immediately if heat stroke is suspected!\n.\nPeople most at risk of heat-related illnesses are seniors, children, athletes and outdoor workers. Try to prevent illness by drinking plenty of fluids, staying away from alcohol and caffeine, wearing light clothing, and if possible, limiting outdoor activity during peak temperature times (mid-day). If you can't limit it, consider using a balanced electrolyte drink along with water, and try to rest in cool, shaded areas whenever possible.:umbrella_on_ground: :deciduous_tree: \n.\nIf you are in a situation where you are taking care of someone who may be suffering from heat stroke, immediately call :hospital:911, move the person to a cool place, loosen clothing to help air circulate over the body, and spray or sponge :sweat_droplets:cool water onto the body until emergency help arrives.\n.\nSource: @cdcgov @mayoclinic""",0,0,68,4,,,

Sweat resistant products may be a good choice for higher intensity outdoor activities. The length of protection depends on the concentration of the active ingredient. Higher concentrations do not work better, but they do work longer! :stopwatch:For example, a spray containing 5% DEET, will provide almost 1.5 hours of protection, whereas a 25% DEET product provides about 5 hours of protection. The CDC recommends 20% or higher to reduce tick bites. :stopwatch:10% Picaridin will provide 5 hours of protection against mosquitoes and up to 7 hours for ticks. 20% protects for up to 7 hours against mosquitos and up to 8 hours against ticks.\n\nDEET and Picaridin are chemical compounds, while Oil of Lemon Eucalyptus is an all-natural product. All-natural does not mean safer. Oil of Lemon Eucalyptus should not be used on those less than 3 years of age. DEET in concentrations up to 30%, can be used on kids 2 months and older. ALWAYS double-check the label to make sure the insect repellent you\xe2\x80\x99re selecting is appropriate for use in children. :check_mark:Some tips for safe use: :light_bulb:A higher percentage of repellent means longer lasting NOT stronger :warning_selector:Don\xe2\x80\x99t apply to cuts or wounds :nauseated_face:Don\xe2\x80\x99t apply to eyes or mouth. :waving_hand_light_skin_tone:Don\xe2\x80\x99t spray on the face!
