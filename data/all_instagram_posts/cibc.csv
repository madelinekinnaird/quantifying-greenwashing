When I left Shanghai and moved to Toronto for five years to work for CIBC, being able to celebrate such occasions was a reminder of my culture back home.\n\nAs part of the CIBC Asian Employee Network in Toronto, we celebrate Lunar New Year each year with a huge event. The bank\xe2\x80\x99s employee networks really make an effort to give people a place to celebrate their own cultures. Because so many of us are away from home\xe2\x80\x94and missing it\xe2\x80\x94during the holiday, it is great to find support through our colleagues and feel more connected to how our families are celebrating back home.\xe2\x80\x9d -Michelle, Director, Asian Banking in Hong Kong, China'",0,0,136,2,,,

I\xe2\x80\x99ve always thought of it as the best way to get to know myself and grow as a human being. To figure out the places that make me the happiest, the people who make me better and the activities that make me feel the most alive by putting myself in new and unfamiliar environments. But travelling, especially as a young female, can be a bit intimidating at times. I\xe2\x80\x99ve learnt over the past few years that having a solid credit card with perks that fit my lifestyle has eliminated a lot of extra stress while out on the road. It's made it easier to track my spending, it's protected me from theft and it\xe2\x80\x99s helped me enjoy my time out exploring the world just a little bit more.\n\xe2\x80\xa2\nI discovered the @cibc Aventura Visa Infinite Card about a year ago. The points I earned from applying for the card and using it frequently over the last 12 months helped me get down to Mexico this fall, relax, and really give surfing a go. Some of the card\xe2\x80\x99s other perks include 4 complimentary airport lounge visits per year, mobile device insurance and I even got a rebate on my Nexus Application Fee. Not to mention the \xe2\x80\x98hotel burglary insurance\xe2\x80\x99 attached to the card helped me get through a pretty tough time when I got robbed down in Costa Rica 6 months ago.\n\xe2\x80\xa2\nSo if you enjoy seeing the world as much as I do, and are looking for a new travel card - invest in yourself by clicking the link in my bio and signing up for the CIBC Aventura Visa Infinite Card today :dizzy: Happy travels #CIBCAventura #sponsored""",0,0,79,1,,,
