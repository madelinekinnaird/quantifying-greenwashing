I could always identify with those who felt like they were different or had to suppress who they are in order to try to fit in.

From that point on, each of us went through a process of learning in order to support Jodie and Penelope\xe2\x80\x94we were all concerned and knew we had to support this young Black child who will have to go against the grain in order to be his true self. For me, it was through reading, speaking to people in the trans community, and reaching out to others\xe2\x80\x94educating myself so I can understand how to help. \nJodie could be any of us that are parents. At the time, the news was a shock, because you\xe2\x80\x99re never prepared for this. There are no maps or directions on how to bring up a child. Penelope\xe2\x80\x99s story could be any child\xe2\x80\x99s story. There was a lot going on during the transition journey, but Penelope is twelve now and it was clearly the right decision. \nI\xe2\x80\x99m fortunate to have been a part of the journey and learned alongside Jodie and Penelope which made me a better ally for women, LGBTQ+ people, and the Black community.

I remember being young and thinking: \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m not a lesbian, I\xe2\x80\x99m not a lesbian.\xe2\x80\x9d There is a big part of me that thinks, if I had grown up in a big city, would I have let myself explore this?\n\nI play a lot of sports, and a few years ago I made a comment about a rugby teammate\xe2\x80\x94who is now my girlfriend\xe2\x80\x94that if I was gay, I would date her. She made me question everything about myself. But it was hard to talk to my friends about it because many of them knew her.\n\nI was surprised when work ended up being the place where I felt most comfortable talking about it. I went up to our LGBT Pride rep in the UK, even though I didn\xe2\x80\x99t know her personally, and asked, \xe2\x80\x9cCan we have a coffee?\xe2\x80\x9d It really helped to have someone who knew none of the people involved and nothing about my personal circumstances\xe2\x80\x94someone who could just listen. It made me really proud to work for a company like Accenture.\n\nI\'m still discovering what I\'ll do for Pride each year because it\'s still quite new for me.

That\xe2\x80\x99s certainly a stretch, but she did have a huge influence in my becoming a proud gay man, as she bought the gay community to the fore at a time when it was marginalized: she had gay and lesbian characters in her videos, she campaigned for greater awareness of HIV/AIDS and \xe2\x80\x98Vogue\xe2\x80\x99 was directly inspired by gay culture. She dared to express her sexuality and project an image of control and fierce independence, and she never abided by social norm. Her songs reflected all of that and then some, and became timeless dancefloor anthems with lyrics to live by. Pure genius.\n\nBut first, it was my sister, Maite, who was my biggest inspiration growing up. She is a strong, intelligent woman who challenged conventions and dared to have a voice in male-dominated circles like politics and the business world of 1980\xe2\x80\x99s Spain. She was a mother figure, a role model and a mentor to me. And she gave me U2, Madonna, Mecano\xe2\x80\xa6 and I\xe2\x80\x99ll never thank her enough for that. \nMy brother Coco has been my strongest ally. He was one of the first people I came out to. When I told him I\xe2\x80\x99m gay, he was so overwhelmingly supportive it caught me off-guard and moved me beyond words. He went out of his way to make sure I got the same unwavering support at home that he has shown me since day one. He is my real-life superhero.\n\nSpeaking of superheroes, I grew up reading the X-Men comics (still do). The X-Men were mutants, born with special talents that make them extraordinary, but because they were different the world feared and hated them. Bigotry was as prominent in those stories as spandex and superpowers, and it was invariably portrayed to be deeply wrong. As a boy and teenager who was bullied for being gay, I could relate to the mutant angst, but I found inspiration in how those characters embraced their gifts in the face of rejection and never ceased to stand up and fight for their right to be different. Those books gave me hope and purpose and shaped me into the fine, live action, queer version of Wolverine that I am today.\xe2\x80\x8b""\n\xe2\x80\x94Luis, Spain\n#PrideatAccenture #Pride #AccentureMoments #:rainbow_flag_selector:'",0,0,1267,20,,,

At this point, I had identified as a lesbian for 5 years and had never dated anyone of the opposite sex. But I went out on a date with him, partially due to some ill-intentioned advice from my homophobic flatmate.\n\nWhile we strolled through Hyde Park, which was heaving with tourists attending the annual Christmas festival, I desperately tried to present as \xe2\x80\x9cstraight\xe2\x80\x9d as possible (meaning, I referred to all previous relationships with the pronoun \xe2\x80\x9cthey\xe2\x80\x9d). Were the butterflies in my stomach because of attraction or dread? It was truly an out-of-body experience, trying to connect with someone while hiding who I am.\n\nAs he kissed me right by the Serpentine river, fairy lights strung on trees all around us, all I could think about was how \xe2\x80\x9cwrong\xe2\x80\x9d it felt for me to be with a man\xe2\x80\x94even as images of a fantasy life spent living in a house with a white picket fence and 2.5 kids flashed before my eyes. And that was so surreal to me: I had identified as a lesbian for so many years, and yet there was still a tiny part inside me clinging to the idea that I could change my sexuality the second Mr. Right came by, if only to be free of the burden and marginalization that comes with being a minority. \nAfter the date, he asked me to visit him in his hometown, which was an hour away. Turning him down, it felt like I was standing on a train platform, watching the train I always thought I would board pull out of the station and leave me behind.

I knew my sexuality at a young age, and I felt like an alien\xe2\x80\x94in the pursuit of visibility I dove into historic tales of queerness, thinking: \xe2\x80\x9cThere has to have been other people like me in the past, queer people who did great things and achieved their dreams.\xe2\x80\x9d I wanted proof that my sexuality wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t define me and that I could be recognized for aspects beyond it. \nMy mother came out to me as bisexual later in my life, well after I had established confidence in my identity. She nervously sat me down and told me she had rekindled a relationship with the only women she had ever loved, her high school sweetheart Gloria, after 30 years apart. She explained how she genuinely loved my father and Gloria, but felt she had to choose a traditional path in order to ever find happiness. Over the years I\xe2\x80\x99ve seen my mom stand up to my family\xe2\x80\x99s religious views. She brought Gloria to family events, despite the glares. Who needs a superhero icon when your mother is this strong? \nMy friends and I typically attend \xe2\x80\x9calternative pride,\xe2\x80\x9d which is grassroots led and non-corporate. Pride started as a protest, but sadly, many folks forget this or even attempt to shame their own community for participating in an alternative pride, which aims to raise awareness of issues affecting the LGBTQ community\xe2\x80\x94just like our queer ancestors did before us. \nToday, we\xe2\x80\x99re amidst an awakening in the United States of the systematic police brutality faced by the Black community. Pride was started by Black and Brown LGBTQ folk. So, in honor of what Pride has always been, I will do my best to stand for the intersectional needs of being both Black/Brown and queer in America in ways that the community requires.

I was born in South Africa to Ghanaian parents who were very religious. I remember being 12 or 13 years old, driving around with my dad when a news story came on the radio: a couple of gay people had been arrested in South Africa. My dad made a comment: \xe2\x80\x9cThey should be locked up.\xe2\x80\x9d That wasn\xe2\x80\x99t just a comment\xe2\x80\xa6 toxic masculinity and black identity are inextricably linked. It was always tough to work out who I am versus what the black community outside wanted me to look like. \nBooks have helped me on my journey: \xe2\x80\x9cThe Color Purple\xe2\x80\x9d was a revelation to me. It gives you a story that\xe2\x80\x99s about empowerment, strength, survival\xe2\x80\x94all of these things that, as a black person or gay person, you associate with.\n\nAnd of course, there are my two idols: Serena Williams and Beyonce\xcc\x81. The world wasn\xe2\x80\x99t built for them. It was built by straight white men for straight white men. So when you see people like Beyonce\xcc\x81 or Serena who transcend this\xe2\x80\x94who represent something far bigger than their art or their sport\xe2\x80\x94they show people that even though you exist in a white world it\xe2\x80\x99s OK to be you and to succeed and to be excellent. \nGenerally speaking, I\xe2\x80\x99ve always been surrounded by love and friends who look beyond my race and sexuality. It made it easier to feel like I exist as me, rather than as a gay man or black man. I was just Michael. That\xe2\x80\x99s why advocating for each other is so important. Intersectionality exists within the Pride community. Gay men are the most privileged. We\xe2\x80\x99re so visible: we have our Elton Johns and Freddie Mercurys. We\xe2\x80\x99ve been accepted more than a lot of other members of our community. So Pride must be about how we can better serve each other.\xe2\x80\x8b\xe2\x80\x8b""\n\xe2\x80\x94Michael, United Kingdom \n#PrideatAccenture #Pride #AccentureMoments #:rainbow_flag_selector:'",0,0,1319,14,,,

But I wasn\xe2\x80\x99t what they\xe2\x80\x99d call \xe2\x80\x9cgirly,\xe2\x80\x9d either. Those were kind of the two options going for someone assigned female at birth when I was a kid. I grew up in the 70s in the Southern U.S. where not standing out was a way of life. I shake my head when I think about how many hair bows I collected while I was waiting to learn the word non-binary. The closest concept we had back then was \xe2\x80\x9candrogynous.\xe2\x80\x9d But by high school, I definitely wasn\xe2\x80\x99t that. I did try to make it work.

I learned queer wasn\xe2\x80\x99t a bad word after all, and \xe2\x80\x9cgenderqueer\xe2\x80\x9d definitely started me in the right direction. \nI remember the first time I heard the term ""gender fluid""; I think I actually stopped breathing. But it wasn\xe2\x80\x99t until I discovered the word \xe2\x80\x9cnon-binary\xe2\x80\x9d that it all finally clicked into place. Now, I live in that word and I feel right. It doesn\xe2\x80\x99t seem like words should matter so much, but they do. You need language to tell your story\xe2\x80\x94even to yourself.\n\nSometimes I still worry I\xe2\x80\x99m not doing it right.

At the time, most gay people in the Philippines were tolerated, but not fully accepted. \nAfter I graduated university, I became very active in LGBTQ+ advocacy organizations. Because of my negative experiences when I was younger, I wanted to become an advocate for others.

I decided to use what I went through at a young age to stand up for the next generation\xe2\x80\x94so what I experienced before will not be the experience of others.
