In the current pandemic scenario, however, it was difficult to find blood, & her family was looking for donors.\n\nI didn\'t even think for a second before volunteering to donate. If there was anything I could do to ease the little girl\'s discomfort, I was happy to help. I reached the blood bank and got tested to see if I was eligible to donate. Once the preliminaries were completed, all I had to do was donate - just like that I saved a life!\n\nI\'ve been donating blood for over 20 years, and I\'ve regularly participated in many Kotak Mahindra Bank annual blood drives.

But I guess the years and years of single-minded dedication and focus paid off.\n\nWhile I certainly put in my 100%, I know that without the support of my family I wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t have been able to achieve my dream. My mother was especially instrumental in me competing at the international level. She went from pillar to post just so I could receive sponsorship for tournaments.\n\nIn 2014, I had to take a hiatus from the sport, but I couldn\xe2\x80\x99t stay away from Karate for too long. I restarted my training in full swing once I was able to, and I made sure to never let anything come in the way of my goals.\n\nHonestly, I strive to be a better Martial Artist every day \xe2\x80\x93 irrespective of whether I\xe2\x80\x99m competing or not. I am now looking forward to participating in the 10th Commonwealth Karate Championships 2020 in Birmingham\xe2\x80\x9c - Natalia Dalal (Manager, Human Resources, Kotak Mahindra Bank Ltd. \xe2\x80\x93 Mumbai)\n\n#HumansOfKotak #EmployeeStories #KotakStories'",0,0,650,8,,,
