China has so far managed to contain the virus relatively quickly, and its economy has a larger share of manufacturing and construction activities, which rely less on face-to-face interaction and benefit from the government boost to infrastructure investment. In fact, we\xe2\x80\x99re seeing many industries in China not only recovering but clawing back lost output not produced during the lockdown, so we expect its economy to return more quickly to previrus levels. \xe2\x80\x93Qian Wang, Vanguard chief economist for Asia-Pacific'",0,0,102,3,,,

What\xe2\x80\x99s Vanguard\xe2\x80\x99s view?\n\nA: Indeed, the hit to economic activity has been severe. We estimate the overall peak-to-trough global GDP contraction was around 9% in the first half of 2020. Comparable collapses in economic activity are hard to find outside wartime: Global GDP fell 6% peak to trough during the global financial crisis, for example, and by 1.8% during the 1973 oil crisis. So what will the recovery look like? Will it be V-shaped or U-shaped? Probably a little of both. We anticipate a first phase characterized by a rapid recovery in the supply side of the economy as businesses reopen and restrictions are eased. We expect that to be followed by a second, more protracted phase in which demand, especially in sensitive face-to-face sectors, only gradually returns. Overall the trajectory of the recovery is likely to be an elongated U-shape, with GDP growth not returning to normal until well into 2021 and quite possibly beyond in major economies. The one exception is China. Our baseline assessment is that a vaccine won\xe2\x80\x99t be widely available before the end of 2021; a vaccine sooner than that would make us more optimistic about the prospects for recovery. But we unfortunately see risks around our forecast skewed to the downside, strongly linked to health outcomes and the potential for instances of the virus to necessitate renewed widespread shutdowns. \xe2\x80\x93Peter Westaway, Vanguard chief economist for Europe'",0,0,102,1,,,

At Vanguard, we stand for inclusion, cultivating difference, and equity. We all have a role in creating an inclusive environment where all crew feel connected, appreciated, and heard. \nHere are some points to keep in mind: \n1. Ask. Check in on your co-workers and ask how they are doing. \n2. Listen with the intent to understand and not to reply. Listening can often be the best support you can offer. \n3. Accept that you may be starting from a place of vulnerability. You may not know much about the situation at hand or have all the right words, but be willing to learn and understand the experience of your fellow crew member. You don't have to be an expert or know all the answers to empathize and demonstrate your interest in others' experiences.\xe2\x80\x9d #InclusionAtVanguard""",0,0,734,17,,,

I was a still a boy when I learned that people looked at me differently and treated me differently. As I grew older, I learned that it didn\xe2\x80\x99t matter how hard I worked or how friendly I was, I was still an object of fear or hate for some, and for no other reason than the color of my skin. While I have been fortunate to achieve a level of professional success, the truth is that if I\xe2\x80\x99m running, biking, or walking down the street, the first thing people see is a Black man. For many folks, that comes with painful assumptions.\n\nAt this stage in my life, my kids are top of mind. I\xe2\x80\x99m the father of two Black teenagers: a 16-year-old son and 14-year-old-daughter. My son just got his learner\xe2\x80\x99s permit. Like all parents, I am worried about him being behind the wheel on his own. But not all parents also have the terror of wondering how he will be treated by those who don\xe2\x80\x99t see him for the sweet, intelligent, responsible child that he is, but instead see a crime waiting to happen. I watch in horror how people of color are mistreated in a variety of settings: law enforcement, the judicial system, the media and in their day to day lives.\n\nFloyd. Arbery. Taylor. The list goes on and on \xe2\x80\x94and those are just the names that make the news. Ask yourself: how did you feel when you saw Colin Kaepernick kneel during the national anthem? Were you upset? Do you now better understand the non-violent protest he started? Do you feel differently about how we as a society treated him and his actions? He was speaking to a wound that is unhealed in this country. It\xe2\x80\x99s a wound that activists have been shedding light on for years, without much progress. I don\xe2\x80\x99t condone the violence and loss of property we are seeing, but I also remember the words of Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr.: \xe2\x80\x9cA riot is the language of the unheard.\xe2\x80\x9d I hope we are listening and are ready to do the work to make this country that we love what it is capable of being.\n\n#InclusionAtVanguard'",0,0,1364,44,,,
