It is a way to have our voices heard as a collective, it is a way to inspire and be a part of change. Each vote counts, even down to the Electoral College, it is our individual voices that make the difference. We have responsibilities as members of a Country to vote for our liberties and how the systems we live in function. Importantly, too, voting on a local level helps ensure that our voices and our belief systems are being looked after, supported and lifted. By electing our local Judges, DA officials, etc.; WE make this happen. \n \nAs many of us are sitting at home wondering if another stimulus check will come, if $1200 is a defining number of our worth, as people are sick and dying and COVID-19 cases rise, as many of us are beginning to wake up to the systemic racism we operate within, the level of white supremacy that runs rampant in our government, our wallets, and our current administration\xe2\x80\xa6we can only move towards a gradual progression in the other direction, a direction in a system that reflects a world that a community can imagine, a much more beautiful and caring world. My vote this election is my commitment to fighting for better options on the 2024 ballot, it is my commitment to fighting for my marginalized neighbors lives, it is a commitment to fight for human rights to not be a discussion that needs to be voted on, but something that is agreed as a given and essential in opening the doors to a future of possibilities and improvements that we are too blind to see now. Voting is about putting our worth out there, defining it for ourselves together, and letting a system know that we are here, we won\xe2\x80\x99t settle, we have rights, and we will fight.""\n.\nPhotography by: @djenebaaduayom\nStyling by:\xc2\xa0@ecduzit'",0,0,19924,159,,,
