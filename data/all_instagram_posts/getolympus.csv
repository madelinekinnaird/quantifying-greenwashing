Earlier that day, I\'d gotten word about a small herd of mountain goats lingering on a mountainside not far from home. I figured this was the perfect opportunity to take advantage of this insanely lightweight setup. When I finally got into the mountains, daylight was fading fast. The goats were already halfway up the mountain and moving uphill faster. I am as light on my feet as a herd of elephants, and rock climb about as well too. I had my work cut out for me. After a solid hour of straight-lining and rock scrambling uphill, I finally managed to get out ahead of the goats to a crevice where I could set up and wait for them to pass by. I got there just in time. Last light lit up the billy goat\'s fur right as he passed by me. Having a camera set up that is small enough that I can stick it in my hoodie pocket while I climb and yet long enough to position me far enough away from my subjects that they didn\'t even notice my presence is amazing.
