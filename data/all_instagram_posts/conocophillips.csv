NFWF and @conocophillips just announced $1.3 million in grant funding to conserve breeding, stopover and wintering bird habitat in the United States. The nine projects receiving grants will protect and restore grasslands, wetlands and coastal habitats, track and monitor bird populations using innovative techniques, and facilitate conservation practices on working ranchlands.\n\nThe grants were awarded through the ConocoPhillips SPIRIT of Conservation Program, a partnership between NFWF, ConocoPhillips and @usfws. With a goal of conserving and recovering populations of imperiled birds, the partnership supports work to improve the quality and connectivity of important bird habitats and accelerate innovations for understanding bird conservation needs across their ranges. \n\nSince 2005, ConocoPhillips, NFWF and the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service have invested more than $13.9 million in projects through the SPIRIT of Conservation program. Grantees have provided an additional $30.5 million in matching contributions for a total conservation impact of $44.4 million. As results of these investments, more than 503,000 acres of important fish and wildlife habitat in 13 states have been conserved or restored.\n\nCongratulations @theconservationfund, @gulf.coast.bird.observatory, @borderlandsresearchinstitute, @manometcenter, @pheasants_forever, @wsgalt, @ducksunlimitedinc  and Winnett ACES!\n.\n.\n.\n#birds #birdsofig #migration #conservation #wildlife #habitat #habitatconservation #environment #nature #grassland #wetland #coastal #science #ranch #habitat #wildlifephotography #wildlifewednesday'",0,0,138,5,,,
