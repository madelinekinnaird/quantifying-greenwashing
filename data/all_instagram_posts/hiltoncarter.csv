I know some of you were like, \xe2\x80\x9coh hell yeah! I\xe2\x80\x99m getting me that new red fiddle leaf!\xe2\x80\x9d Hahaha! Those red spots are caused by edema which happens when the cells in the tissue of your fiddle burst because of inconsistent watering. It\xe2\x80\x99s a little stressful for us to see this in our fiddle friends but don\xe2\x80\x99t worry too much, as the foliage matures and grows out, the redness should fade. These red spots will only occur on new growth, so if you see a leaf that was once green is now turning a bit reddish/orangish, you have other issues at play. That could be because your fiddle is getting too much direct sun and your foliage is getting sunburnt. To prevent edema happening on your fiddle leaf fig, only water when the moisture of the soil tells you, so there really can\xe2\x80\x99t be a schedule for watering this plant. What I mean by that is you can\xe2\x80\x99t just say your fiddle leaf fig needs to be watered every 7 days. It needs water when the moisture of the soil is at least 2\xe2\x80\x9d or half of the top half of the soil is completely dry. So in the winter months, that might be every 10 days while in the summer it was every 7. Lastly, make sure your pot has drainage and that you\xe2\x80\x99re not letting watering sit in your base tray.

I call this little dude, \xe2\x80\x9cCheetah Jack\xe2\x80\x9d because he likes to stunt in his cheetah print pot. The Kangaroo foot fern, obviously from down under aka Australia, is one of my favorite ferns because of its beautiful waxy foliage that resembles that of a kangaroo foot. \n\nWhen it comes to caring for this wild child, treat them like most ferns. Make sure you place them in a spot in your home that gets bright INDIRECT light to medium like. But they prefer bright indirect. Whatever you do, don\xe2\x80\x99t get plant protective services called on you by placing them in direct sun.

This means when you press down on the surface of the soil a bit of soil should stick to your finger. But if you press down and water rises up from the soil, it\xe2\x80\x99s too wet. So when keeping them hydrated, it\xe2\x80\x99s good to place them in containers that hold moisture better, like a ceramic glazed pot or a plastic container. I\xe2\x80\x99ve been keeping Jack in his nursery pot. And as a gentle reminder, make sure you have a drainage hole and water until you see it drip through. \n\nThe Kangaroo Foot fern styles best in hanging planters but do you. I felt Jack looked best in this cheetah print because If their foliage starts to creep along the floor, you\xe2\x80\x99re just want to keep from stepping on them. And if you were concerned about your fur friends, don\xe2\x80\x99t be. This dude is friend to the animal community. \n\nOk, I\xe2\x80\x99ve said enough. Now go love on your plants!

As they say, knowledge is power, and where I grew up, there was no one guiding me or those around me on how to properly save money. Financial plan? The plan was to pay the bills. Anything after that was bonus aka play money. Maybe you\xe2\x80\x99d get to go to the movies that week or eat out. \n\nAs a kid, you\xe2\x80\x99re also taught that your appearance matters, so even if you were poor you tried to look your absolute best. So, as I grew up I started placing more value in material things. Instead of saving I would find myself spending money on new clothes, shoes, devices, etc. You know, the old adage, fake it \xe2\x80\x98til you make it. All of this putting me into a deeper and deeper hole. With college debt also on my shoulders, it all felt so heavy. I knew I needed a plan regardless of how much money I had in the bank.\n\nWhat I realized is that saving and having a financial strategy isn\xe2\x80\x99t just for high income individuals.  At some point you have to understand how to manage what you have to accumulate wealth. It\xe2\x80\x99s the small, daily decisions, that make the big impact in the long term. Being able to assess where you are financially, outline what your values are, i.e. do you want to focus on paying off debt, buy a home, travel, etc. These are the discussions our advisor had with us to determine our goals and formulate a unique plan on how to meet those. \n\nHonestly, so many of us aren\xe2\x80\x99t taught how to be financially literate when we\xe2\x80\x99re young, ultimately setting us down the wrong paths in adulthood.

A man can dream right? In that same moment, inspired, I thought, maybe I should use the extra time I had once I left my day job(working at an ad agency) to have a side hustle in styling homes in Baltimore. \nI discussed this idea with my then girlfriend, now wife, and like everything I bring her way, she totally supported it.

You see, at that point I wasn\xe2\x80\x99t sharing much. Once we moved in, I started posting images of our new apartment and people started to take notice. Many took notice to the plants. As they asked questions on how I cared for them, I started to share more about that but still trying to find the balance of sharing about styling. All of this lead to opportunity after opportunity, which lands me where I am today.

Rotate so that your plant doesn\xe2\x80\x99t get heavy on one side and not the others.\n:keycap_4: If you\xe2\x80\x99ve had it over a year, start fertilizing come spring through summer.

At this time your plants are starting to show off a bit, unfurling new growth and smelling themselves! With that being said, it\xe2\x80\x99s also good time to do some \xe2\x80\x9cspring cleaning\xe2\x80\x9d with them. For me, caring for the life in my home is a good source of meditation and reflection. Something I\xe2\x80\x99m sure all of us can use right now. So while you\xe2\x80\x99re doing your part and staying home, here are a few things you could be doing with your greens friends:\n\n1. Cleaning the dust off your leaves will help them absorb a bit more light coming into your home. I like to use a rag dipped in lukewarm water and a touch of mild dish soap. Make sure to do a second wipe down with just water after. While you\xe2\x80\x99re at it, take the time to clean your windows as well. Again, dirty windows can create a filter and decrease the amount of light coming into your space.\n2. Rotate your plants! Those branches that have been living closer to the inside of the home are jealous of the branches living in the window. They see that those branches produce new growth faster and they want that as well. Rotate your plant to encourage growth and balance. No one wants a lopsided plant. :winking_face:\n3. Repot! I know you\xe2\x80\x99ve been putting it off but those plants that have overgrown their pots need a larger pot to produce more leaves. Especially if you\xe2\x80\x99re seeing roots grow out of the drainage holes. Remember, the best time to repot is the day you were planning to water your plant. Dry soil and plants are easier to remove from a pot than wet soil. \n4. \xe2\x80\x9cFeeeeed Meeeee\xe2\x80\x9d Any of you remember the movie Little Shop of Horrors? While Audrey 2 wanted blood, your plants aren\xe2\x80\x99t as demanding but would like a little food too. So it\xe2\x80\x99s important to fertilize your plants through spring and summer. I know, you want to know what fertilizer to use. Well there are many of them out there to choose from. So make sure to ask the nursery/plant shop which works best for the plants that YOU have. \n5. Talk to your plants. Now that you\xe2\x80\x99re home, tell them how much you appreciate them making your home a paradise. That positive energy is something your plant thrive in. \nI hope this helps.

They say you never get a second chance at one. So with my new book WILD INTERIORS, I wanted to make sure that first moment caught you and wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t let go. To do so I figured I\xe2\x80\x99d have to take a chance and think a bit outside the box of your typical plant book cover. I needed it to pop out of the screen, off of your coffee table, off the store bookshelf, and demand for you to pick it up to see what\xe2\x80\x99s WILD inside. To make that happen I reached out to @alina.fassakhova, who was already being featured in the book, and commissioned her to create a piece of art that would not only have her style present but mix in foliage in a subtly abstract way. If you couldn\xe2\x80\x99t see the foliage before, I hope you can now. I wanted something that felt fluid, wild and ALIVE...and she nailed it! When I received the first physical copy I couldn\xe2\x80\x99t stop smiling. It\xe2\x80\x99s so beautiful. The cover is everything I hoped it would be and more. The wonderful touch to emboss part of the title and my name is so cleeeeeeeean!(swipe L for a detail) I gotta shoutout the art dept over at @rylandpetersandsmall for that! I don\xe2\x80\x99t see WILD INTERIORS as just a plant book and I hope you don\xe2\x80\x99t as well. It\xe2\x80\x99s so much more. It\xe2\x80\x99s an interiors book, coffee table book and an art book in one. While Wild at Home was 144 pages, WILD INTERIORS is 224 pages of goodness. And that\xe2\x80\x99s because of the beautiful people and spaces that grace those pages. While a major part of the book follows the journeys in greenery of 12 plant lovers from across the US and Europe (@whitneyleighmorris @dabito @roomandroot @deecampling @marimasot and others)we also cover the best plants for particular rooms, my top 10 favorite plants right now and how to care for them and my favorite green filled spaces around the world. Arriving worldwide APRIL 7th, I hope your first impression stops you in your tracks and makes you want to take a look inside. Available for preorder now at @barnesandnoble and @amazon!
