Some say Hellboy was Gus\xe2\x80\x99 'breakthrough' mixtape. And certainly many of Gus\xe2\x80\x99 fans became fans because of Hellboy. Hellboy is a gritty, raw, & intense piece of work in which Gus expresses feelings of anger, sorrow, loneliness, and determination. It is passionate. It is daring. And it kicks. It showcases Gus\xe2\x80\x99 love for the guitar. The songs Gus chose to make Hellboy arose from his work with a small group of producers. These young men sampled some great, classic songs & guitar riffs, and combined them with modern drums/808s for Gus to lay his vocals on & really wobble your rear view mirror.\n\nSix of the Hellboy tracks were made in a loft apartment in Skid Row\xe2\x80\x94an apartment Gus was so proud to move into. It was the first space he & his collaborators could work in that was their own. For months, they had been living in other people\xe2\x80\x99s places. For this first time, he & his producers could do what they wanted. They did not have to worry about noise complaints any more, and they didn\xe2\x80\x99t have anyone else telling them to abide by the 'house rules.' There were no rules.\n\nGus & his roommates certainly hosted some 'poppin' parties. But there were also many evenings when one might open the door to find the place relatively quiet\xe2\x80\x94the 'core group' working in small groups scattered in different spaces of the loft, making music. In that way, Gucci Mane, OMFG, Red Drop Shawty, Girls, Fucked Up, and Cobain were created in a kind of artists\xe2\x80\x99 workshop\xe2\x80\x94an atelier. That was the environment Gus was so excited to move into in late July, when he called me to tell me about it.\n\nAt the same time, however, Gus was being faced with increasing pressure.  He was a 19 year old with too much on his shoulders. That stress comes out in the music. For all young people feeling stress, Gus pours & sometimes screams his heart out for them. For every young person feeling overwhelmed, broken-hearted, hurt, and angered by girlfriends & boyfriends\xe2\x80\x94Gus spoke for them too. For some people, Hellboy is a breakthrough work. To me, it is a beautiful, honest, raw expression of feeling\xe2\x80\x94with some kickass beats.\xe2\x80\x9d""",0,0,135663,2322,,,
