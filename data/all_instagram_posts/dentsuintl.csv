Communicate more than before with your colleagues and use video camera in your catch ups to make it more personal\n7. Have regular check-ins on workload, offer support or ask for help when you need it\n8. Don't forget to move! Take extra time to incorporate exercise into your routine - go for a run, do yoga in your living room, or join one of the many available free online dance classes\n9. Do go outside (if you still can) for some extra vitamin D - try working from your balcony or garden if you have one\n10. Eat well and stay hydrated - take the time to look up a new recipe or what to do with the ingredients you already have in the house\n11.
