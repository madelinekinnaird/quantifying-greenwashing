That means an industry with a predictably steady growth rate has suddenly shrunk to a fraction of its size. It is unclear how protracted the decline will be, though demand is likely to bottom out in 2020 before returning to pre-crisis levels several years from now. The timing will depend on many factors outside the industry\xe2\x80\x99s control.\n\nIn the longer term, aviation is likely to undergo structural changes with regard to demand and the degree of industry consolidation, along with unprecedented government support. That transition provides an opportunity to rebuild the industry for a low-carbon future, something that airlines have been grappling with for some time.\n\nEven before the coronavirus pandemic began, the industry was facing the challenge of reducing its carbon emissions in line with international goals to reach net-zero emissions by 2050. Forces that have buoyed the case for sustainability\xe2\x80\x94including customers and regulators worried about emissions and unpredictable future carbon policies\xe2\x80\x94have shifted with the pandemic, as airlines\xe2\x80\x99 survival seems to be at stake.'",6764,20.666,292,3,,,

Millions lost power, some for days or weeks, shutting down businesses and creating public safety issues. In addition to winds knocking out one-fourth of cell phone towers in the Northeast, the loss of electricity forced many towers offline after depleting their emergency batteries. Eleven billion gallons of sewage flowed into rivers, bays, and coastal waters because severe inundation overwhelmed municipal wastewater systems. In total, the storm caused about $70 billion in damages. \n\nBut despite being one of the costliest and most destructive storms on record, this event was not an aberration. Nine of the costliest mainland US hurricanes on record have occurred in the past 15 years. Going forward, climate change is expected to further intensify these risks.\n\nInfrastructure usually involves large investments in assets that are designed to operate over the long term. Coal-fired plants are designed for 40 to 50 years, for example, and hydropower dams and large geotechnical structures for up to 100 years. To date, the design of these facilities typically has assumed a future climate that is much the same as today\xe2\x80\x99s. However, a changing climate and the resulting more extreme weather events mean those climate bands are becoming outdated, leaving infrastructure operating outside of its tolerance levels.

Many cities around the world are exposed. Strong winds during storms and hurricanes can drive coastal flooding through storm surge. As hurricanes and storms become more severe, surge height increases. Changing hurricane paths may shift risk to new areas. Sea-level rise amplifies storm surge and brings in additional chronic threats of tidal flooding. Pluvial and riverine flooding becomes more severe with increases in heavy precipitation. Floods of different types can combine to create more severe events known as compound flooding. With warming of 1.5 degrees Celsius, 11 percent of the global land area is projected to experience a significant increase in flooding, while warming of 2.0 degrees almost doubles the area at risk.'",11712,20.533,249,3,,,

Find this article and the full collection of our thinking on #climaterisk at our link in bio.\n\nThe period after the COVID-19 crisis could determine whether the world meets or misses the emissions goals of the 2015 Paris Agreement, which were set to limit global warming to 1.5\xc2\xb0C to 2\xc2\xb0C.\n\nAchieving those goals is a distinct possibility. A low-carbon recovery could not only initiate the significant emissions reductions needed to halt climate change but also create more jobs and economic growth than a high-carbon recovery would. \n\nOur analysis of stimulus options for a European country suggests that mobilizing \xe2\x82\xac75 billion to \xe2\x82\xac150 billion of capital could yield \xe2\x82\xac180 billion to \xe2\x82\xac350 billion of gross value added, generate up to three million new jobs, and enable a carbon-emissions reduction of 15 to 30 percent by 2030. Such a package need not involve economic compromises. \n\nA recent survey of top economists shows that stimulus measures targeting good environmental outcomes can produce as much growth and create as many jobs as environmentally neutral or detrimental measures.1 But a high-carbon recovery could make it hard to meet the goals of the Paris Agreement, and heavy relief and stimulus spending might leave governments too debt-strapped to pay later for emissions cuts.\n\nFinding a low-carbon, high-growth recovery formula isn\xe2\x80\x99t easy. It requires assessing stimulus measures with respect to complex factors, including socioeconomic impact, climate impact, and feasibility. But our analysis highlights the chance for policy makers to assemble a package that quickly creates jobs and economic demand, produces steady growth, and accelerates the uptake of zero-carbon technologies. \n\nGovernments can use the framework described in the article we link to in our bio to design and carry out a low-carbon recovery agenda that could meet the immediate economic needs and improve the long-term well-being of their people.'",3609,21.666,221,2,,,

But when copper prices dropped, the plan changed. They resolved to find ways of increasing output without a big capital outlay. Executives felt that good opportunities to boost production could be found in one part of the operation: the ore-concentrating mill, where rocks containing ~0.4% copper get ground into a powder of 25% copper and 75% rock.\nUsing AI techniques, Freeport-McMoRan could scan the vast quantity of performance data it already collected from the mill, identify operational changes that might raise performance, and put them to the test in the field. Managers and technicians at the company began working with McKinsey consultants and data scientists according to agile principles, quickly developing functional AI solutions and then improving them little by little. They soon discovered that the mill\xe2\x80\x99s standard control settings didn\xe2\x80\x99t optimize copper output from every type of ore that was entering the mill. Adjusting the controls to suit each ore type could raise copper production by 10% or more.\nThe team conceived, tested, and fine-tuned algorithms that would look at sensor-generated data and recommend controls to maximize copper output. They also sped up the feed of copper ore from the mine to the mill. Copper production increased substantially. In the fourth quarter of 2018, throughput exceeded 85,000 tons of ore per day\xe2\x80\x9410% more than the previous quarter\xe2\x80\x94and the mill\xe2\x80\x99s copper-recovery rate rose by one percentage point. Those gains should lift Bagdad\xe2\x80\x99s copper production by 20 million pounds per year, an increase that has allowed Freeport-McMoRan to avoid most of the $200M capital expansion of the Bagdad concentrator complex. \nThe company will soon launch a similar program at Cerro Verde, a copper mine in Peru that produces 5x as much copper as the original mine in Arizona. With AI and agile methods, Freeport-McMoRan is recovering more copper from low-grade ore that would have been considered waste just ten years ago.\nLearn more at mck.co/miningAI'",0,0,1006,12,,,
