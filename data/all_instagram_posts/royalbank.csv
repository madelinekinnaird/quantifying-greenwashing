If someone you can about is in touch less frequently or you hear a change in their tone, this may be a sign that an abuser is limiting their contact with others.\n\n5.\tPrioritising buying non-essentials\nSomeone experiencing financial abuse might prioritise a particular bill or buy expensive items to meet the demands of the abuser, who may be spending more time at home.

Try searching online/booking outside the peak times of Friday evening to Sunday evening to secure a holiday bargain. (Marianne, Personal Banker)\n.\n:small_orange_diamond: Check cashback websites before booking anything to see if you could get some money back for flights/hotels/package holidays.  I recently had \xc2\xa3124 paid into my bank account from cashback deals and used it towards the next holiday!\n(Kim, Payments Controls)\n.\n:small_orange_diamond: Use the Tiquets app to book tickets to attractions in lots of places around the world, often at a discount and without needing to queue to collect the tickets.\n(Clare, Commercial Banking)\n.\n:small_orange_diamond: Book accommodation in advance with the free cancellation until a few days before you're due to stay - you can then cancel it if you spot a great advanced payment date nearer the time.\n(Tom, Infrastructure Solutions)\n.\n:small_orange_diamond: Always Google search to see if there are any voucher codes for the company you are using. (Sarah, Cash Operations)\n.\n:small_orange_diamond: Comparison sites like Skyscanner are good but it's also often worth checking the actual airline sites for the same flight before booking as they're sometimes cheaper.\n(Peter, Mainframe Technical Specialist)\n.\n:small_orange_diamond: Always ask about ATOL protection when booking a package holiday and make sure you get travel insurance as soon as possible after booking. You don't have to get insurance with the travel agent you book with, but it does support that booking straight away, no matter how far in the future it is.  And if you're not booking a package holiday, check if your travel insurance covers for cancellations.\n(Campbell, Fraud Management)\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n#RoyalBankOfScotland #SummerHolidays #Holidays #Travel #TravelTips""",0,0,21,3,,,
