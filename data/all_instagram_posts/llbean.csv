All store employees will receive pay and benefits during the closure.\n\nBy making this decision now, we can better ensure the safety of our employees and customers, as we all continue to navigate a rapidly evolving situation and follow the CDC\xe2\x80\x99s guidelines around the importance of social distancing.\n\nL.L.Bean was founded 108 years ago on the simple but profound principle that we\xe2\x80\x99re at our best when we\xe2\x80\x99re outside. Today, more than ever, we believe the outdoors is still the best place to find perspective and connection \xe2\x80\x93 and to help us all feel better. A short walk outside or looking out the window to see signs of spring can be an important counterbalance to the pace of news and information we\xe2\x80\x99re receiving.\n\nWhile our retail locations will be closed for the next two weeks, our business remains open. Our customers can still find what they need on llbean.com or by phone. If you have questions about your order, our products, or just want to hear a friendly voice, call us at 1-800-441-5713. Rest assured, our teams working across operations \xe2\x80\x93 including our home agent service representatives \xe2\x80\x93 are following strict CDC guidelines, including practicing safe working distances and adhering to additional cleaning protocols.\n\nDuring this period, our social channels will focus on simple ideas and images that inspire and remind us of the restorative power of the outdoors. If you have outdoor moments that you would like to share with us, we\xe2\x80\x99d love to hear from you.\n\nThank you for being a valued L.L.Bean customer.
