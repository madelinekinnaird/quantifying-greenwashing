She says, ""I\'ve been adjusting to a full-time work schedule at TD Industries since ACC has moved all of their classes to an online format. This semester is my last before I graduate which makes it a little bittersweet since the ACC\'s welding shop is closed. \xe2\x80\x8b\n\nThe work I do is in a fabrication shop. We build pipe manifolds for kitchens, bathrooms, and huge air conditioners that regulate fluid flow or gas. We build off of blueprints that are needed for different job sites, so for example, right now we\'re working on welding 300 flanges to 8"" pipe for a chill water line that will be for a job site downtown. Once it\'s built, we deliver it to the job sites and it gets installed. \xe2\x80\x8b\n\nAs far as leaving my house for work during these times it\'s definitely stressful. You know, sharing tools or using the same machines that my coworkers use is something I constantly think about, but we are required to wear masks now, and we use Lysol wipes to clean our job boxes along with the tools in them. We have a limited number of people who can work in the shop, so we all keep our distance. I think we\'re all pretty happy that we still have a job, and we\'re still getting our forty-hour workweek in, especially during these difficult times. \xe2\x80\x8b\n\nMy word of advice for other essential workers is to be mindful of what your hands and work gloves touch. Be mindful of your surroundings along with the people you\'re surrounding yourself with. Personal health is important and is something that shouldn\'t be taken lightly. As construction workers, there\'s a stigma that we have to be tough as nails and never miss a day of work. This makes taking time off difficult to do, but it\'s not worth putting other coworkers at risk. \xe2\x80\x8b\n\nWhat keeps me motivated is truly loving what I do and seeing the finished product when it comes to welding and building these manifolds. I can see and feel myself improving every day with help from the people I work with. They\'re extremely smart and innovative, so every day I learn a new way to do something which helps with that motivation!"" #FriendsofCarhartt'",0,0,5168,29,,,
