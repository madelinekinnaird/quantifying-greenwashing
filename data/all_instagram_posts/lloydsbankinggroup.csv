We\xe2\x80\x99re creating 10 new woodlands with volunteers from the Group, schools, and community groups planting the trees.  We\xe2\x80\x99re encouraging farmers to plant trees on their land through subsidised planting schemes, and in addition to this we\xe2\x80\x99ll be supplying over 500,000 free trees to schools and community groups to plant in their local area.\n\nI\xe2\x80\x99m really proud of the work that I do as the Corporate Account Manager with the Lloyds Banking Group/Woodland Trust partnership.

This year it falls on the 14th of November. For me, Diwali always means decorating the home with lights, dressing up in traditional clothes and enjoying delicious feasts with family and friends. I\xe2\x80\x99m very fond of some Diwali traditions like drawing \xe2\x80\x98Rangolis\xe2\x80\x99. These are beautiful patterns drawn on the floor by entrance of homes using coloured sand, rice or flower petals. They are believed to bring in prosperity and good luck to homes. I used to draw flowers and birds with my mother back in India and is a practice I still follow.\n\nThe history behind Diwali has different interpretations in different parts of India. In northern India, it is believed that King Rama returned to his kingdom Ayodhya along with his wife, Sita after defeating evil king, Ravana. The residents of Ayodhya welcomed them by lighting rows of clay lamps on the streets. In eastern India, people worship Goddess Kali, the destroyer of evil forces.\n\nEvery year we attend temples and other venues in north London to offer our prayers to Goddess Kali, following which there is always a party at home where we get together to exchange gifts and sweets with friends. Firework displays also form an integral part of Diwali celebrations, though they are gradually declining owing to environmental safety causes. \n\nDiwali will be different this year, but I\xe2\x80\x99m still looking forward to the virtual celebrations. We have already started decorating the home with fairy lights, candles, oil lamps and flowers.

REACH aims to support members to realise their full potential and achieve their aspirations, while promoting an ethnically and culturally diverse workforce. It\xe2\x80\x99s something I support alongside my role that is very rewarding and opens up many opportunities to meet different people across the Group with varying cultures and backgrounds; and as a Black female it\xe2\x80\x99s so important to me to work in an environment that is inclusive and enables me to bring my whole self to work. \n\nInitially I joined the network supporting with our regular communications e.g. newsletters and blogs, however, I started to get more involved with events and signature initiatives such as our Black History Month campaigns. Last year, I took part in various conversations and activity that focussed on sharing the need and importance of increasing Black representation at senior levels within the organisation. \n\nThis year the Group introduced the Race Action Plan and committed to increasing Black representation at senior level to at least 3% by 2025. I am so pleased that the Group have made a public commitment to reaching this goal and supporting Black colleagues with progression within the organisation which will complement the overall Black, Asian and Ethnic Minority targets. \nI feel really proud and honoured to be part of the many changes that are to come across the Group.\xe2\x80\x9d \n\n- Chanae, REACH Network Volunteer\n\n#LBGVoices #BlackHistoryMonth #DiversityandInclusion'",0,0,81,2,,,
