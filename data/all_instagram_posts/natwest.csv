Here's how to stay safe shopping online:\n\n1. Background checks\nDo your research on the seller and check contact details on their website. Alarm bells should ring if there\xe2\x80\x99s no phone number or no physical address. Be aware that some sites may use a .co.uk web address, even if they\xe2\x80\x99re located abroad. If in doubt, don\xe2\x80\x99t shop there.\n\n2. Your card is king\nIt\xe2\x80\x99s always safer to shop online using your debit or credit card. NEVER pay by bank transfer. Would you hand over cash to a stranger? No. It\xe2\x80\x99s the same with paying by bank transfer as you\xe2\x80\x99ll lose your money if something goes wrong. Be suspicious of anyone asking you to do that \xe2\x80\x93 it\xe2\x80\x99s a classic trick.\n\n3. Keep your data safe\nDon\xe2\x80\x99t give away any personal or secure information on websites you\xe2\x80\x99re not sure about. And if anyone ever asks for info such as bank login details, passcodes, card reader codes, remote access to your device or asks you to move money from your account, don\xe2\x80\x99t do it. It\xe2\x80\x99s a scam.\n\n4. Beware of surprise emails \nHave you noticed how many emails you get around Black Friday? Scammers love to catch people out with fake offers. So don\xe2\x80\x99t open anything you didn\xe2\x80\x99t sign up for and watch out for emails or texts offering free gifts. Click on the link and you could end up with a computer virus.
