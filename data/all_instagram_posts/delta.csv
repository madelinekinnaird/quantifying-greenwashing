Yet they made me who I am today, a proud Afro-Latina with roots dating back to the Taino Indigenous People of Dominican Republic. \n \nAs a young girl, I hid from the thought of having a strong accent, so I watched the news to perfect a more \'acceptable\' one.

That\xe2\x80\x99s right, after receiving an undergraduate degree from Hampton University, I joined Delta as a Flight Attendant. That first day filled me with a range of emotions: the excitement in starting a new career, the uncertainty of being accepted, and an insane pressure to succeed. As my career progressed, I began to take these emotions as a condition of being a Black woman in corporate America.\n \nAcceptance is a universal desire, but being an ambitious, working woman in corporate America creates additional pressures, including the likelihood of isolation and failure. Add the blessing of being African American, and you have a greater probability of not achieving your goals.\n\nMore than once, I\'ve been guilty of shrinking myself to allow others to feel more comfortable. It can be exhausting, surfing through the constant advice women often receive: \xe2\x80\x9cSpeak up."" ""Ask for what you want."" ""Earn your seat at the table."" while also hearing ""Don\xe2\x80\x99t be aggressive, or sharp or too direct, you don\xe2\x80\x99t want to be seen as intimidating."" \n\nWith maturity has come the confidence to embrace my authentic voice. There are still moments when I reflect on all the advice, particularly when I may be the \xe2\x80\x9conly one\xe2\x80\x9d in the room. Now, these reflections reinforce a need to be true to me versus working to fit someone else\'s idea of how a woman should show up.\n \nMy advice?

We were talking about the kinds of music we love to dance and listen to. I talked about how I loved music that was birthed out of the Caribbean, like Dancehall, Reggae, Bachata, and Zouk.

My answer leads back to a simple idea\xe2\x80\x94cultural exchange. Being Black is a travel superpower. By engaging people on a human level and allowing them to learn about me, they open themselves up to the same. The reality is, there aren\'t as many people of color exploring some lesser-known destinations and events.\n\nIt might surprise you that after visiting 95 countries and living in 11, the most common thing I learn is that I\'m the first Black person many have met. From big cities like Istanbul and Bangkok to rural towns like Slobozia and Colonia del Sacramento, the lack of first-hand interaction with my people is common. The last five years of Black travel has been nothing short of amazing. With brothers and sisters sharing stunning images from destinations from around the world. Finally, putting melanated faces in the travel space regularly. But unfortunately, there is still a lack of Black travelers at cultural events and smaller known destinations. I believe the future is not only about sharing our stories, it\'s about engaging with locals in meaningful ways that allow for genuine cultural exchanges. Now is the time for the Black travel community to lead the way in ethical and sustainable tourism. In the future, we can create truly magical memories and cultural understanding by visiting smaller locations and exploring events relevant to the native populations of our destinations. Giving everyone involved a chance to understand each other better.\n\nThe future of Black travel is in sustainable and ethical travel. #blackhistorymonth""'",0,0,4524,60,,b'Malappuram',11.0667 76.0667

That could be the reason why I actually find flying tranquil and soothing. I have a 10-month old niece and we want her to experience the joys, thrills and opportunities that traveling offers.\n\nTravel for me opened many doors from education to therapy and ultimately starting a food business collecting flavors from around the globe and blending them with my native West African spices. One of the ingredients I use in my sauces is tamarind. Even though the tamarind plant originated from sub-Saharan Africa, the spice in our sauce is sourced from Thailand. Coming to Thailand helped me make the connection with the local food, which highlights the tamarind fruit. The trip to Thailand and my many other travels allow me to continually connect the dots showing the differences in cuisines but also how food unites us no matter where we are. Travel, therefore, can be a conduit for businesses across different borders, whether in food, tech, fashion or design. Whether you\'re looking for inspiration, sourcing ingredients or looking for raw materials, travel can be the spark you need to start your own business.\n\nThe future and landscape of travel are changing. When I moved to the US, it was difficult to explain to people where Ghana was located. But now, Ghana is one of the hottest travel destinations; everyone from Hollywood to Wall Street is in Ghana either for cultural exploration or business engagement. Last year, 2019, marked 400 years since the first slave ships landed on United States soil from West Africa and the Ghanaian government invited the entire black diaspora to return home and see Ghana as a land of opportunity; to visit, to invest and to make it home again.\n\nThrough my experiences as an immigrant moving to the US and establishing a food business, I aspire to break the stereotypes for immigrants wanting to dream beyond borders but especially to inspire my niece to be fearless in her pursuits and goals through travel; the world is her oyster. #blackhistorymonth""'",0,0,8755,90,,"b'Krabi, Thailand'",8.0589 98.9124

I didn\'t expect to see myself in the locals. Yet there I was, quads burning from dropping it low and the impending food coma lulling me to sleep under the stars.
