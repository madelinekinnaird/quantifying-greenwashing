Here\xe2\x80\x99s a moment from her career that reminded her to never let others\xe2\x80\x99 assumptions stop her from achieving her goals: \xe2\x80\x9cWhen I was working for a trade association trying to find a champion to pass legislation that we were seeking, I frequently spoke to a senior member of Congress about sponsoring the legislation. After several phone calls and emails, we decided to meet. During the meeting, I was told they had no idea that I was African American by the way I spoke on the phone. This caught me by surprise since I was on Capitol Hill (but at the time, diversity on Capitol Hill was low). In the end, I was able to get this member of Congress to sponsor the legislation and pass it. This moment reminded me to not let my skin color, gender, or how I speak keep me from getting the job done, and it has led to great career opportunities.\xe2\x80\x9d #BlackHistoryMonth #splunklife'",0,0,90,4,,,

I learned a valuable lesson about being coachable, sharing and receiving tough feedback, and repairing relationships when things go wrong. I reached out to the leader, owned up, and she ended up being an advocate for me in my executive coaching.
