Here are some eco-friendly ways to improve happiness (the results may surprise you)! 1. Live More Locally. Modern transportation such as the car were expected to result in a new era of individual freedom. However, the way our society has restructured around the car has resulted in a range of unforeseen social problems; pollution, noise, stress, obesity, respiratory problems and traffic accidents. By spending less time travelling on a day to day basis, people have more time for their families and leisure pursuits, improved city air, better health, as well as happiness. But living local isn\xe2\x80\x99t just about reducing transport. Consuming more local produce, or by growing your own are other ways. Shopping more locally can also increase your regular contact with people in your community and interpersonal relationships are consistently found to be the most important correlation with human happiness.\n\n2. Get moving. The consensus that regular physical exercise is a vital part of maintaining health and wellbeing has existed for at least a decade. Walking, cycling and/or using public transport instead of car travel can have dual health benefits by providing the required physical activity levels and reducing the adverse health effects of motor vehicle transport.
