I\xe2\x80\x99ve lived with Type 1 Diabetes as my constant companion for 35 years, since I was 2 (despite CLEARLY only being 25, right?! :winking_face:) I love helping people with diabetes to get healthier, happier and more confident in their own care. I also love creating healthful magic in the form of big events.\n.\nI\xe2\x80\x99m a speaker, a writer and an advocate for #t1d. In fact, being on stage and sharing what I\xe2\x80\x99ve learned on my journey is one of my favorite things to do! Workshops, meet ups and sharing what I know in other ways are definitely up there, too.\n.\nMy base is just outside Z\xc3\xbcrich, Switzerland :Switzerland: with my husband. We (normally) travel a lot, as we are both fortunate enough to work for ourselves AND only need a good internet connection to do so. I\xe2\x80\x99m so grateful for that opportunity - I love traveling and discovering new places, foods, cultures and people.\n.\nI\xe2\x80\x99m an avid real food-foodie and love all types of food, particularly those that help make my blood glucose easier to manage. I\xe2\x80\x99m also known to enjoy the odd glass of wine (or bubbly).\n.\nI\xe2\x80\x99m determined to reach goals I set for myself, which comes in handy being an entrepreneur and all. At the same time, it\xe2\x80\x99s incredibly important for me to enjoy everything life has to offer.\n.\nIf you ask me, Diabetes is a holistic thing to deal with, so treating it with simply medication, food and exercise is cutting yourself short. There is the whole mind-body component to it, as well as hydration, proper nutritional supplements, and, of course, stress management (HUGE blood sugar killer!), amongst others.\n.\nI hope to motivate at least one of you today by sharing snapshots of my life, diabetes, movement, food, tips and tricks\xe2\x80\xa6 You know, the usual, but in a lockdown situation.\n.\nJump onto the Novo Nordisk stories throughout the day to see how I cope during #lockdown. Looking forward to seeing you there!\n.\nI\xe2\x80\x99d love to learn more about you - tell me where you are in the world in a comment below!\n.\nThis is a sponsored activity by Novo Nordisk.
