I\xe2\x80\x99ve joked that quarantine is really just our \xe2\x80\x9cultimate bonding experience\xe2\x80\x9d. My lovely roommates and I hope that by the end of June we can put on a faux graduation ceremony on the front lawn of our house and invite our parents to watch (6 feet apart) from the street. Overall, I could not be more grateful for my incredible friends, my supportive family and one thing I know for sure is that I\xe2\x80\x99ll never take my freedom, my health, and my recreational activities for granted again! Cheers to the class of 2020! Be well and stay safe!\xe2\x80\x9d Stay tuned for more graduate features in the coming weeks. #stayNspired'",0,0,4073,83,,,
