We know we\xe2\x80\x99ve got work to do and so it didn\xe2\x80\x99t feel right to make a public statement; we know we need to start with ourselves. But we\xe2\x80\x99ve listened to what our colleagues and customers have told us, and we know that our silence might have looked like we didn\xe2\x80\x99t care. But we do care.

So we\xe2\x80\x99re sharing with you what we shared with our colleagues.\n\nThe horrific death of George Floyd in Minneapolis last week has sparked a global protest against racism and injustice towards black people. The protest has been global because this is a global challenge, including in the UK, and it is right that we - as a UK business and an organisation of thousands of colleagues - show our support for everyone, everywhere who is impacted by racism, discrimination or bigotry.\n\nAs a 78,000 strong business - with colleagues working across the UK and the world - with different experiences and views, we must start with ourselves and make sure M&S is a place where everyone feels they can be their full selves and their voices are heard. Like most businesses and probably most people, we\xe2\x80\x99ve got work to do to make sure we are a truly inclusive place to be that encourages real diversity of thought and opinion. We committed to this change when we signed the Race at Work Charter which will help us frame some of the work we need to do internally.\n\nOur colleague networks are also crucial in spearheading change, and we encourage all of our colleagues to take this moment to decide what individual action they can take and invite everyone - members of the black community and allies from all communities - to share what is on your mind.
