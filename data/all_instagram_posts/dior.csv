This is how Christian Dior, upon founding his House, sketched out the essence and the spirit of this sensual floral chypre, which paints an olfactory portrait of a dream garden.

Miss Dior made its appearance, as the New Look triumphed, like a bold manifesto for a new kind of femininity, a bewitching elixir inseparable from the success of that first show on February 12, 1947, an event that would shape the history of fashion. A few years later, the founding couturier also created the fully flower-covered Miss Dior haute couture dress, then Marc Bohan made it an emblem of female emancipation in the sixties by naming a ready-to-wear line after it. Its undeniably couture bottle is engraved with the houndstooth motif and its neck elegantly embellished with a dagger bow.
