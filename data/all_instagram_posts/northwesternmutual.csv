So I partnered with\xc2\xa0@NorthwesternMutual\xc2\xa0to tell my story of how my wife and I made the decision to finally speak with a financial advisor.\n\nTwo years ago my wife and I had gotten married and the thoughts of starting a family and purchasing a home were happening more frequently. So after a year of flirting with the idea of getting an advisor, we took the step and actually did it. We were ready to outline a financial map for our family so that we could create the right paths to reach these goals.\n\nWhile I was ready to take this step, I\xe2\x80\x99ll have to admit, I was a bit stressed about this because while my wife and I had discussed our financials verbally, this was laying everything out on the table and being completely transparent and vulnerable. They say money is one of the leading reasons why relationships break and we knew we needed to get streamlined and have our finances combined before it could cause a rift.\n\nI grew up in a family that didn\xe2\x80\x99t speak much about money, let alone how to save for the future because why stress about tomorrow when the rent is due today. Everyone around me was living check to check and as I entered adulthood, this became a reality to me as well. There were times where I feared even looking at my bank statements. But I knew I needed to take control my life and my future. The only way to start saving for me was to truly make an effort to do so.\n\nThe testimonials presented throughout the duration of my partnership with\xc2\xa0@northwesternmutual\xc2\xa0may not be representative of the experience of other clients and are not a guarantee of future performance or success.\xc2\xa0#ad\xc2\xa0#financialadvisor'",0,0,171,0,,,
