God-willing, it will be seen as a turning point in race relations. The pain, fear, sadness and anger felt by the Black community, and also by the vast majority of people globally, is palpable.\n\nSo what can we do?\n\nMorgan Stanley\xe2\x80\x99s Black Managing Directors sent out a memo to express their hurt and pain on behalf of our Black community and to be there as leaders by collectively contributing to the @NAACP_ldf. I applaud their leadership. \nAs a Firm we can do more, and we will do the following:\n\n1.  Carol Greene-Vincent, Head of Global Internal Audit, will join Morgan Stanley\xe2\x80\x99s Operating Committee, the most senior governing body of this Firm. I was planning on having her join at the end of 2020, but I have accelerated her appointment to June 30.\n\n2.  Susan Reid, Global Head of Diversity and Inclusion, will join Morgan Stanley\xe2\x80\x99s Management Committee as of June 30.\n\n3.  In her elevated role, Susan will create a new Institute of Inclusion, modelled after our successful Institute of Sustainable Investing. It will have an independent advisory board that I will chair. Among many things, it will be responsible for setting policy, putting in place metrics, coordinating our internal and external voice, and overseeing the mentoring, development and promotion of our diverse employees. The Institute will be properly funded, initially with $25 million, to ensure it can successfully complete its mission.\n\n4.  Just as our Black Managing Directors have contributed to the @NAACP_ldf, the Firm will make a donation of $5 million. In addition, the Firm will match dollar for dollar U.S. employee contributions to the Fund. \n5.  We\xe2\x80\x99ve added a new fifth value to our core values. While Committing to Diversity and Inclusion is implied in \xe2\x80\x9cDo the Right Thing,\xe2\x80\x9d it is time to make it explicit.\n\nI urge all employees, whatever their race, color or political persuasion, to embrace these changes as we try to do our bit to make Morgan Stanley the place of choice to work for anyone of any background.'",0,0,2563,59,,,
