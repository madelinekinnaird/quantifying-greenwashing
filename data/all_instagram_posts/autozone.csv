I went in looking to replace the glass on my passenger side mirror and he went above and beyond to help. He custom cut a \xe2\x80\x9cglass\xe2\x80\x9d piece for me from a kit and installed it. Turns out the quality wasn\xe2\x80\x99t good so he helped me choose something else that was better as a temporary solution while another part could be ordered. Really the best customer service imaginable. So appreciative. Thank you George.\n\n#GetInTheZone #AutoZoner""",0,0,398,12,,,
