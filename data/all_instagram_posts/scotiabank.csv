When prices rise, your money buys less.\n\nThe erosion of purchasing power is the most familiar problem. Commonly-purchased household goods become more expensive, and so a single unit of currency loses value as it buys fewer goods and services.\n\nFor example, $100 in 1968 was only worth $14.02 in purchasing power in 2018. For a forward-looking example, if a cup of coffee costs $2 today, and the annual inflation rate was 5%, in 30 years that same cup of coffee would cost $8.64!\n\nAs an investor, you should be aware of inflation. If you earn less than the rate of inflation on your investments, you would face reduced purchasing power when your investments are converted into cash. The good news is, with a sound investment strategy you can guard against inflation and help maintain your purchasing power and standard of living in retirement. \n\nSee the @scotiabank link in bio to read the full article.\n\n#FLM2020 #FinancialLiteracy #finlit #money #finance'",0,0,116,2,,,

One of the main benefits of an RRSP is that you defer paying taxes on the money you put in today and any investment income earned, until you withdraw your money in retirement. \n\nA TFSA, or Tax-Free Savings Account, can be used to save towards many different goals, because you\xe2\x80\x99re free to withdraw at any time without penalties.
