So when the team at Donley\xe2\x80\x99s Concrete Group had the chance to work on the infield expansion, they knew they had to be part of it. Donley worked on the concrete services portion of the venture, with support from @the_cat_rental_store and local Cat dealer @cartermachinery.\n\nFor the team at Donley\'s, working on the project meant tackling new challenges to coordinate a range of requirements needed to create the new fan experience. \xe2\x80\x9cThere\'s about 100,000 square feet of concrete slab for the infield entertainment areas,\xe2\x80\x9d said David Coleman, Project Controls Manager for Donley. \xe2\x80\x9cThis was a unique challenge to build, as it needed to be within strict tolerances to allow race cars to travel over the slab to winners circle and allow race fans an up close and personal relationship with the race.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nThe Cat Rental Store was a major player in helping Donley\'s get the work done, supplying everything from generators, wheel loaders, soil compactors, skid steers, and mini excavators to light plants and plate compactors. ""It\xe2\x80\x99s a great relationship to have with Caterpillar when we can call our dealer and say \xe2\x80\x98something just came up, I need this equipment yesterday, and gone tomorrow\xe2\x80\x99,"" Coleman said.\n\nSee more \xe2\x80\x94 visit our bio :link: for the story. #LetsDoTheWork #caterpillar95'",0,0,5552,21,5573,Richmond Raceway,37.5923014867 -77.4194526672
