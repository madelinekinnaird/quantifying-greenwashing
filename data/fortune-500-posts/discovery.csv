I carried out 40 hours of searching in 5 days, only to have 10 seconds in front of it and it was almost night. \n\nMany have asked me why I was so interested in this species. The Iberian Lynx is a clear example of a success story in conservation. In 2002 the species was critically endangered with only 94 specimens and after 18 years, with much work, it has been possible to recover almost 700 specimens. Although much work remains to be done, this model can be copied for  other species with this degree of threat. \n \nPhoto + Caption: Fernando O\xe2\x80\x99Farrill\xe2\x80\xaf(@fernando_ofarrill) \n\n#lynx #ghost #wildcat #endangeredspecies #wildlife_perfection'",0,0,104411,406,104817,,
