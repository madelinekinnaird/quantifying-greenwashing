They say money is one of the leading reasons why relationships break and we knew we needed to get streamlined and have our finances combined before it could cause a rift.\n\nI grew up in a family that didn\xe2\x80\x99t speak much about money, let alone how to save for the future because why stress about tomorrow when the rent is due today. Everyone around me was living check to check and as I entered adulthood, this became a reality to me as well. There were times where I feared even looking at my bank statements.
