The Delta Honor Guard is a volunteer group of employees dedicated to caring and honoring fallen soldiers during their travels home. When a solider is transported to their final resting place, they are met by family, military personnel and the Delta Honor Guard, who march with flags from all five military branches.\xe2\x81\xa3\n\xe2\x81\xa3\nFor over 15 years, Atlanta employee Brian has led our Honor Guard ceremonies showing respect to those who have made the ultimate sacrifice. Brian has continued to make sure these honorable moments continue when our fallen heroes arrive, so they receive a proper ceremony for their service to our country. \xe2\x80\x9cI feel honored to be able to serve on the Honor Guard team and take this responsibility as if it was my own family member. It\xe2\x80\x99s a sobering experience to stand in tribute, but it\xe2\x80\x99s our way of serving our country and ensuring our heroes are well cared for on their journey home.\xe2\x80\x9d - Brian, Honor Guard Coordinator - #ATL \xe2\x81\xa3\n\xe2\x81\xa3\nTo all the fallen heroes who have fought for our freedom, thank you.'",0,0,20716,209,20925,,
