There's no other city in the South that has the food reputation that New Orleans has. And Gumbo is supreme in the Big Easy. Vegans can have gumbo too! \n\nThis gumbo is full of flavor and easy to make. The Simple Truth Chorizo sausages make this recipe stand out because of the spice flavor the sausage gives your roux. Roux is a mixture of flour and coconut fat cooked together to thicken the soup. If you can't travel to New Orleans in 2020, cooking this gumbo up will put you there in no time.""",3454,58.333,245,40,285,,

We would drive out and spend the morning together on the water enjoying nature and catching as many fish as we could. By noon, we would be in the backyard and I would watch my dad clean the fish so they would be ready for dinner.
