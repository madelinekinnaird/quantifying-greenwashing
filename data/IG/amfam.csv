American Family Insurance employee Derek Kosmicki shares his firsthand experience with cancer and how his family, coworkers and agency owner helped him battle through, as did the knowledge he had life insurance. \xe2\x80\x9cWell, we found a cancer.\xe2\x80\x9d It was Feb. 25, 2019 when the doctor broke the news while I was still waking up from my colonoscopy sedation. There\xe2\x80\x99s probably no good way to tell someone they have cancer, so you might as well open with it.\n\nIn the coming weeks, I had surgery to remove a third of my colon, 39 lymph nodes (two that were cancerous) and a portion of a kidney. After a week in the hospital and another month to recover from that (which left me with a 6-inch scar on my stomach and an enviable set of 2-pack abs), I began chemotherapy. Three months, six treatments, and countless side effects later, I successfully completed treatment.\n\nI\xe2\x80\x99ve tried to keep a positive mindset through it all, with varying degrees of success. After all, I\xe2\x80\x99m 39 years old with three children under the age of eight \xe2\x80\x93 some tears and fears are surely expected. And, I don\xe2\x80\x99t know if/when this cancer may come back. Still, staying positive has helped me realize a few things.\n\nI learned that fear and modesty are terrible reasons not to go to the doctor. \nI am incredibly fortunate. \nThe amount of support I\xe2\x80\x99ve had from American Family, from my boss to everyone in Personal Lines Underwriting Operations, has been special. From the beginning, they\xe2\x80\x99ve made sure I didn\xe2\x80\x99t have to worry about work, and instead could focus on getting better. It\xe2\x80\x99s meant the world to me and I can\xe2\x80\x99t imagine ever working anywhere else because of it.\n\nLife insurance matters.\n\nFinally, I realized how truly blessed and lucky I am. It would\xe2\x80\x99ve been nice to have this epiphany without a cancer diagnoses, but better late than never. I really understand what Lou Gehrig meant in his famous speech. He was right.\n\nI have cancer, but I\xe2\x80\x99m the luckiest person I know.\n#EmployeeStory #Company Culture #CancerSucks #LifeInsuranceAwarenessMonth'",0,0,31,1,32,,
